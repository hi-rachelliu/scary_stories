cannibal clan at the gas station,149l8ac,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/149l8ac/cannibal_clan_at_the_gas_station/,zapzapgigathunder,"The place was a hellhole in the middle of nowhere. A sign taunted ""Last chance for gas."" The pumps wheezed and hissed, and the store was a dungeon of darkness and grime. The only people who dared to come here were freaks and killers. They stared at us with a blood thirsty hunger that chilled us to the bone as we pulled up our truck.   Max got out of the car and went to the pump. He put his credit card in and started to fill up the tank. He looked around nervously, like he was expecting trouble. He saw a bunch of bikers who were wearing leather and metal. They had tattoos and piercings all over them. They were smoking and drinking and making noise. One of them saw Max and pointed at him. He said something to his friends, and they all laughed.  Ivy got out of the car and went to the store. She needed to go to the bathroom and get some food. She was wearing a red jacket and black pants. She looked like she didn't care about anything. She walked by the bikers and ignored them. They tried to talk to her but she snubbed them. She went into the store and saw a man who was working there. He was bald and fat. He had a scar on his face and a gold tooth in his mouth. He was chewing gum and reading a magazine. He looked up at Ivy and smiled weirdly. He said, ""Well, hello there, gorgeous. What can I do for you?""  I huddled in the truck, clutching my backpack full of books and gadgets. I wore a blue hoodie and gray pants, hoping to blend in. I was shy. I hated being there. I felt a knot in my stomach, like something bad was going to happen. I looked out the window and saw Max at the pump. He looked like he wanted to leave. I saw Ivy at the store. She looked like she could handle anything. I saw the bikers at the corner. They looked like they wanted to hurt us.  I heard a loud bang. It was a gunshot. I felt the bullet whizz past my ear. I saw Max drop the pump and run to the truck. He opened the door and got in. He said, ""We have to get out of here. Now!"" He started the engine and put it in reverse. He looked at the rearview mirror and saw a biker holding a shotgun. He had shot at Max but missed. He was reloading and aiming again. Max said, ""Hold on!"" He stepped on the gas and backed up fast. He hit the biker and knocked him down. He turned the truck around and drove away.   Ivy had heard the bang too. She saw Max running to the truck. She saw the biker with the shotgun. She saw another biker coming out of the store with a knife. He was heading towards her. She grabbed a can of soda from the shelf and threw it at him. It hit him in the face and made him stumble. She ran to the door and saw Max driving away. She yelled, ""Wait for me!"" She ran after the truck and jumped in. She slammed the door and said, ""Go, go, go!""     Max clutched his side. Blood seeped through his fingers. ""Ivy, take the wheel!"" he shouted. They switched seats in a flash. Max ripped off his shirt, revealing his muscular chest. I gasped as I saw the bullet wound. It looked deep and painful. ""Did it go through?"" I asked, trying to sound calm. ""Yeah, I think so,"" he said, gritting his teeth. He opened the glove compartment and grabbed a medkit. He quickly bandaged himself up, while I watched him. He smiled weakly and sighed. He whispered to himself, ""That was close.""     Max reached for the medkit again. He opened it and took out a bottle of painkillers. He popped the lid and poured some pills into his hand. He was about to swallow them when Ivy slapped his hand. The pills flew out of the window. ""Hey, what are you doing?"" Max asked, annoyed. ""You can't take that many. You'll overdose,"" Ivy said, sternly. ""I'm in pain, Ivy. I need something to numb it,"" Max said, groaning. ""Well, you can't have those. They're bad for you,"" Ivy said, firmly. She grabbed the medkit and threw it in the back seat. Max sighed and rolled his eyes. He reached into his pocket and took out a joint. He lit it and took a puff. He offered it to Ivy. ""Want some?"" he asked, smiling. Ivy looked at him with disbelief. ""Are you kidding me? You're smoking weed while we're being chased by cannibals?""    ""Oh please, how do you know that they were cannibals?"" he asked her.   She shrugged. ""I saw a human skull on their bike,"" she said casually. ""And it had bite marks on it.""   ""That doesn't mean anything"" he said. He took another puff and passed it to me.    I looked at him with horror. ""Are you insane? You're offering me weed while we're being chased by cannibals?"" I asked him. He shrugged. ""It's good for you. It helps you relax and forget your troubles,"" he said. I shook my head and pushed the joint away. ""No thanks. I don't need to relax or forget my troubles. I need to survive and escape from these maniacs,"" I said. He smirked and took another puff. ""Suit yourself. But don't blame me if you miss out on the best high of your life,"" he said. I rolled my eyes and looked away. ""Yeah, sure. The best high of my life,"" I muttered sarcastically.   Max laughed and said, ""Now what are the chances of that?"" He pointed ahead. There was a roadblock.",scarystories,0,2023-06-14 18:31:21
Vanity,149gzul,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/149gzul/vanity/,Dawnstar1932,"Sitting down at the black Victorian vanity my husband got me, I start to do my makeup. It is date night after all and I would love to look pretty for our anniversary.   ""Tonight is going to be wonderful,"" I think to myself while applying make-up and smiling to myself. As I look back up something isn't right, my lipstick is a little too smudged and my eyeliner turned into the dark circles like a raccoon.  ""Whatever, I'll just fix it,"" I wipe my face with a make-up remover towel and start again, looking back up.  My eyes... were they always a piercing emerald green?  ""Maybe it's just the lighting,"" I look away to grab and reapply the eyeliner, and out of the corner of my eye I don't think I see my reflection move with me. But it doesn't matter, I have to look pretty. I need  to look pretty for my anniversary tonight.  I start again and start humming a tune I heard from Spotify. Things went well, I was looking and feeling great! And I look at our alarm clock to check when he'll be home from work. Big scarlet letters told me he had thirty more minutes until he got home. When I looked back something was off about my makeup, I couldn't figure out what but I had the time to fix it.  Wrong, wrong, wrong. Everything I've tried is just wrong. Different colour eyeshadow? Wrong. Different lipstick? Wrong. I tried minimalistic, but that was wrong too. Everything so far hasn't looked pretty enough to impress him.  Accidentally stabbing my left eye with my eyeliner pencil a little too hard, while lost in thought. I look at my reflection to see how bad it is. grinning broadly with an eye so irritated it looked like it was bleeding. Then it hit me.  I stab my eye again, harder this time until I can feel the warm red liquid streaming down. The perfect shade of red to accentuate my lips. It wasn't enough though, because pain is beauty, and the ultimate beauty is...  Grinning wider now I see my reflection, smudged in makeup stained in blood. It writes 'pretty' on the mirror, in the warm scarlet liquid. Not entirely in control of my own actions I grab my metal nail file...  Raising the beauty tool to the side of my neck I know what needs to be done, as I thrust it into the side of my neck just behind my jaw, and I know I have truly become pretty.",scarystories,0,2023-06-14 15:39:32
"Once upon a time in Hollywood - Chapter 3, part 1",149gw5w,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/149gw5w/once_upon_a_time_in_hollywood_chapter_3_part_1/,Interesting_Bread_16,"Once upon a time in Hollywood - Chapter 3, part 1  The clue from Dregus led Smanulescu to a sinister place consumed by the shadows of the city. Curiously, he followed the trail that led him to an obscure porn film rental shop. The bleached letters of the name ""Dirty Cunts"" flickered seductively on the greasy facade of the establishmen  Smanulescu cautiously entered the store and was greeted by a stuffy atmosphere. The twilight was filled with a heavy scent of sweat and desire. The small, run-down room was equipped with shelves filled with countless DVDs of various porn films. Faded posters adorned the walls, while in the background, the monotonous moaning of a cheap hardcore porno could be heard.  Behind a worn-out counter stood a man who surpassed Smanulescu's worst expectations. Tucă Bibulescu, a medium-sized man in his forties, was the owner of this repulsive establishment. His gaunt body was clad in a faded suit adorned with stains whose origins were better left unexplored. He was half bald and the greasy hair that remained on the sides was tied into a ponytail, intensifying Bibulescu's perverse aura. His sticky skin glistened in the dim light of the store, as he regularly wiped the sweat from his forehead. Overall, his appearance testified to an erstwhile attempt to appear respectable that had ultimately given way to neglect.  Bibulescu, unaware of Smanulescu's identity, greeted him with a mocking, challenging grin. His voice was marked by a repugnant tone that made Smanulescu's blood freeze. ""Well, well, well, look at this. Another lost wanderer in search of the depths of pleasure,"" he whispered with an arrogant and sleazy manner that exceeded the boundaries of decency. ""What kind of porn are you looking for, my friend? I have everything in my little paradise of lust!""  As if Bibulescu's introduction wasn't enough, Smanulescu felt sticky chunks of feces clinging to his buttocks, constantly fueling his aggression. He forced himself to remain calm and not lose control. Stepping closer, determined and without changing his expression, he said, ""My name is Smanulescu, I'm a private detective. I'm currently investigating a case where a contact led me to this..."" Smanulescu slowly turned around, incredulously surveying the interior. ""...establishment. He mentioned that a group gathers here to worship the darkness  ""A group, you say? All sorts of groups gather here all the time. Bachelor parties, porn consumption clubs... but a group that worships the darkness? That sounds ridiculous, buddy,"" said Bibulescu, a smug grin crossing his face. Doubt began to rise within Smanulescu. He felt like a schoolboy who had lost a bet and now had to engage in trivial conversation with this shady character. He struggled to push back against the self-doubt when he realized once again that chunks of feces were sticking to his buttocks. ""Listen here, you slimy piece of shit! If you don't tell me everything you know about the group right now, I will defecate in your store!"" Smanulescu shouted, his face turning red. Bibulescu remained unimpressed by Smanulescu's threats. With raised eyebrows and a mocking smile, he countered, ""Oh, how brave you are, little man. Do you seriously think you can intimidate me? I've experienced worse than you and your perverse fantasies."" Smanulescu turned pale at Bibulescu's words. How did he know about his fantasies? ""Don't think you can hide them, buddy. Ha! I can smell the shit on you from five meters away!""  The tension in the air began to crackle. Smanulescu's patience had reached its limit. He no longer wanted to fight with words but with actions. In a swift move, he launched his fist towards Bibulescu, hitting him square in the face with full force. Bibulescu stumbled backward, landing roughly on the floor, blood spewing from his nose.  In that moment, as Smanulescu demonstrated his superiority, he seized the opportunity to torment Bibulescu in a particularly vile and humiliating manner. He leaned over him, his mouth opening as the unmistakable stench of feces escaped. Bibulescu desperately tried to escape the smell, but he couldn't avoid the repugnant breath. Panic-stricken and disgusted, he struggled to free himself, but Smanulescu's grip was firm.  ""Tell me everything you know now, or I'll do the same to your mother, you filthy wanker!"" Smanulescu shouted, chunks of his last meal falling from his mouth and landing on Bibulescu's face. ""Okay, okay, please, just stop!""  to be continued",scarystories,0,2023-06-14 15:35:21
When Day Breaks,148vgab,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148vgab/when_day_breaks/,Divine1nstincts,"As we arrive at the affected area, we notice the devastating effects of SCP-001. The sun's rays have transformed people into amorphous, flesh-like entities, and they continue to propagate the infection. Our primary objective is to rescue survivors and escort them to designated safe zones where they can receive appropriate containment and medical care.  We equip ourselves with specialized hazmat suits, capable of providing protection against the sunlight and the infectious effects of the anomaly. Our communication devices allow us to coordinate with our team and gather information about survivors in need of assistance.  We move cautiously through the streets, searching for survivors while being mindful of any potential threats. Our training and experience help us navigate the chaos, identify safe routes, and utilize containment protocols to neutralize any infected individuals we encounter.  Our primary concern is to offer reassurance and support to the survivors we come across. We provide them with guidance on how to avoid direct sunlight, reassure them that we are here to help, and lead them towards safety. We also provide basic medical aid and monitor their condition to ensure they don't show signs of infection.  Together, we work efficiently and effectively, ensuring the safety of as many civilians as possible. Our dedication to the MTF's mission drives us forward, even in the face of this daunting and dangerous SCP-001 outbreak.  Startled by the yelp coming from the old war bunker, we exchange a quick glance, confirming our shared concern. We immediately move towards the sound, cautiously approaching the entrance of the bunker. With our flashlights casting beams of light into the darkness, we call out, announcing our presence and offering assistance to whoever may be inside.  As we inch closer, our ears strained for any response, we hear a weak voice, pleading for help. It's coming from deep within the bunker. We exchange a nod, silently agreeing on the course of action.  With utmost caution, we descend into the bunker, keeping our guard up and flashlights sweeping the surroundings. The atmosphere inside is tense, filled with a combination of musty air and echoes of the past.  Soon, we locate the source of the distress call—a wounded survivor, trapped under debris, struggling to free themselves. Working together, we carefully clear the rubble, ensuring not to trigger any further collapses.  Once the survivor is freed, we assess their condition, offering words of comfort and reassurance. We quickly administer basic medical aid, tending to their injuries as best we can given the circumstances.  As we treat their wounds, we engage in conversation, attempting to gather information about other survivors in the area and any potential dangers we should be aware of. Their fear and confusion are understandable, and we strive to provide support, explaining our role as MTF personnel and the steps we're taking to contain the SCP-001 outbreak.  After ensuring the survivor is stable, we assist them in navigating the bunker and guide them towards the designated safe zone. Throughout the process, we maintain open communication with our team, updating them on our progress and the discovery of the survivor.  Our duty is to safeguard as many lives as possible, and with this newfound survivor under our protection, we push forward, ready to face the challenges that lie ahead.   As our team regroups, we communicate with them through our radios, sharing the information about the survivor we found and their account of others in the vicinity. The team acknowledges the update and informs us that they have also discovered a few survivors scattered across different locations.  With a sense of urgency, we decide to split up to maximize our effectiveness in locating and aiding the remaining survivors. Our shared objective is to ensure their safety and guide them to the designated safe zones.  As we carefully make our way down the streets, our attention is suddenly drawn to a disturbing sight—an instance of SCP-001, an abomination composed of melted candle wax-like substance with numerous eyes. We pause, assessing the situation, aware of the immediate danger it poses.  Taking note of your remark about the flammability of the creature due to the oils in our skin, I swiftly retrieve a road flare from my equipment. Igniting the flare, I throw it with precision at the SCP-001 instance. The flare makes contact, causing the creature to erupt in flames, its horrifying form consumed by fire.  We maintain a safe distance, observing the result of our action, ensuring that the threat has been neutralized. The flames burn brightly, reducing the SCP-001 instance to ashes. With this immediate danger dealt with, we continue our search for the remaining survivors, mindful of potential encounters with other anomalies.  As we progress through the streets, we rely on our training and expertise to identify any signs of survivors and maintain constant communication with the team. Our priority remains the well-being and protection of those affected by the SCP-001 outbreak.   After weeks of tireless search and rescue operations, spanning across Montana and Maine, we finally conclude our efforts, having successfully located and aided all the survivors in those areas. It has been a challenging and emotionally demanding task, but our determination and dedication have paid off.  Regrouping in Michigan, we take a moment to rest and gather our thoughts. The weight of our experiences and the gravity of the SCP-001 outbreak weigh heavily on us. As we discuss the progress made and the lives we were able to save, a sense of satisfaction mixed with lingering concern fills the air.  Knowing that the SCP-001 instances will eventually die on their own, we decide to head back towards Site-19, the secure facility of the SCP Foundation. It's a temporary respite, a chance to regroup, debrief, and prepare for future containment and research efforts.  During our journey back, we maintain communication with the command center at Site-19, updating them on our successful search and rescue mission and the overall situation on the ground. Our collective knowledge and experiences gathered from the field will contribute to the ongoing understanding and containment of SCP-001.  Once we arrive at Site-19, we undergo a debriefing session, sharing valuable information and insights with our superiors and fellow MTF members. We provide detailed reports on the outbreak, the behavior of the SCP-001 instances, and any anomalies we encountered along the way.  While we await the eventual demise of the SCP-001 instances, we remain vigilant and ready to respond to any unforeseen developments or emerging anomalies. Our duty as MTF personnel extends beyond the initial crisis, encompassing ongoing containment, research, and protection of the general public.

Song of Soliloquy,148pyeq,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148pyeq/song_of_soliloquy/,Thick_Mick_Chick,"If there was one thing Soliloquy hated? She really hated being proven wrong. She knew she couldn't be right about everything but she HATED being 100% sure she was wrong. It made her look stupid and stupid was something Soliloquy most certainly was not.   She wasn't like the other kids. Mama said that was okay. We weren't meant to be like everyone else. What makes us different also makes us special. Soliloquy believed it because there's no way Mama would lie to her.   Mama was so smart. She'd picked up on all of the little things Soliloquy did as a baby and, then, a toddler. Mama knew Soliloquy was such a ""special"" girl. Only she truly believed in Soliloquy. She'd never known her Daddy. Mama didn't care for talking about him too much. From what little Mama did say about him? It's probably better off that way.   She'd been so little when the first incident happened. Mama knew for certain then. There'd been no doubt left in Mama's mind. Mama had been busy and didn't get Soliloquy's bottle warmed up for her in a timely fashion. She was just a baby and had no way of controlling her anger. It wasn't poor Mama's fault, either. She had her hands full being a single mother. It just exploded. Mama said that it scared her so! She was grateful she hadn't been close to the microwave because the glass went everywhere. Mama knew from that day that she could never be late with Soliloquy's bottle ever again.  Now? This turdy boy thinks a tomato is a fruit?! Why would he think that?! EVERYONE knows tomatoes are vegetables!  ""Dummy! I'm trying to tell you! If you weren't so freaking poor? Maybe you could afford a cell phone and Google it, Stupid!"" Grover Dill was not a nice, cute, clean nor smart boy. All he was to Soliloquy was trouble and headaches. He'd bullied her every since kindergarten and he hadn't let up one day from then until now. He hasn't even slowed down in the 6th grade. Mama always tried to talk Soliloquy down when he tormented her so. She really hoped she made it home this time so Mama could do it, again. Soliloquy knew if she had another ""spell""? Mama would be so disappointed. Please, please, please, let her make it back home, again.  ""At least I'm not named after a Sesame Street muppet!"" Soliloquy could feel tears sting her eyes.   ""And your name means you talk to yourself!"" Grover just had to say something. He couldn't just let it go.   She was walking away. She was trying so hard. It was happening, though. She wasn't getting flushed. She was getting HOT!  ""GROVER CLAUDE DILL! DON'T SAY NOTHIN' ELSE TO ME!"" Soliloquy was burning up.  ""NOTHIN', WHITE TRASH!"" Grover was cackling and Soliloquy was coming unglued.  She kept trying to distract herself. It wasn't helping. Where would it go this time? What would it mean? She should ""put it"" somewhere. But put it where?  ""Back off! Calm down!"" Soliloquy shut her eyes and kept repeating the 2 phrases, over and over, more to herself than anyone. Something was cracking, splitting, something was breaking!  Soliloquy opened her eyes to see Grover Dill standing underneath a tree with a very heavy branch that was cracking and breaking. Of course? Being the hillbilly, redneck, The Hills Have Eyes inbred that he is? He was too busy cackling like an old mountain witch to notice.   ""I should tell him. I should. Mama would be disappointed, but I just can't take anymore of him!"" Soliloquy debated with her conscience. She knew it was wrong. You ain't suppose to be doin' wrong. Sweet little baby Jesus, she just couldn't take him, anymore. So? Soliloquy settled on, ""What Mama don't know won't hurt her.""   She looked up at the branch. It honestly could've went either way, at that point. She knew which way it would go this time.  The tree branch groaned in protest as it continued to break away from it's perch. Then? CRAAAAAAACK! In the words of John Mellencamp (one of Mama's favorites since she's from Indiana, too)? It came ""Crumblin' Down.""   It all seemed to happen in slow motion. The branch completely broke free and plummeted towards Grover's useless head. Soliloquy thought, ""It's going to be more useless in about 3 more seconds."" And? Soliloquy stifled a giggle.  Boom! Soliloquy couldn't believe what she'd seen. The branch fell on Grover just as he threw his head back to laugh harder. BAM! Smack in his face! Grover let out a guttural scream as the branch slammed his face and the rest of his body folded like an accordion as he fell to the sidewalk. He was breathing really funny and it sounded wet. Oh, no. She thought it would just knock him out! This was more than she could deal with. Mama would know how to handle this. She was so sure of it!   ""Better look around and see if anyone was watching."" Soliloquy began scanning the school, playground and sidewalk she was on. School had been over for awhile. No one was around. Don't ask? Don't tell. She ran all the way home.  Contrary to the skid mark named Grover Dill's opinion? She most certainly was not white trash. It was true that all that Mama could afford was a trailer. The trailer was clean and Soliloquy had her own room and she was happy. She didn't have a problem so why did that poster child for abortion have to say such mean and hurtful things? Did that make him deserving of a death sentence? As Soliloquy peaked the little hill right before her house? She saw Mama out in the front yard. Thank the Lord! She'll know what to do.   ""Soliloquy, Baby? That you?"" Mama looked up as she rounded the corner. Soliloquy ran to her until she almost passed out.  ""Mama! I didn't mean to, Mama!"" Soliloquy began to plead her case just as soon as she saw her.  ""Baby! What's happened?"" Mama's furrowed brow let Soliloquy know she was very concerned.   ""Mama! I swear, Mama!"" Soliloquy finally reached Mama and hugged her like she'd never let go.   ""Come inside, Baby, and tell me what happened."" Mama took Soliloquy inside and they both sat on the couch. Soliloquy was so happy to be home if not happy about her circumstance.  ""Mama! It was Grover, again!"" Soliloquy was tearing up   ""What did he do this time, Soliloquy?"" Mama asked as if she were irritated that his name even got brought up.  ""I didn't know, Mama. I really thought tomatoes were vegetables. Grover told me they are actually fruit."" Soliloquy timidly approached the subject.  ""And that was the fight?"" Mama knew there had to be more to this.  ""No, there was more. That's just what started it."" Soliloquy replied and Mama nodded her head in acknowledgement.   ""He just wouldn't stop, Mama. He just..."" Soliloquy burst into tears.  ""Soliloquy? Did you have another spell?"" Mama always got right to the point.   Welp. There it was. The time to cough it up. ""I tried not to, Mama. Please, believe me!""   ""Soliloquy? Tell me what happened and tell me what happened right now. I'm not angry, but I do need to know."" Mama was getting more upset.  ""Deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth."" Soliloquy said to herself.  ""Okay. We kept arguing and he was saying really nasty things and I was getting so mad, Mama!"" She couldn't hold back.   ""He was really hurtful and hateful and I... I....."" Soliloquy tapered off.  ""You had a spell?"" Mama already knew.  ""Yes, Mama. I did."" Soliloquy replied and stayed silent.  ""How bad was it, Baby?"" Mama resigned herself to the fate of knowing it has most certainly happened, again.   ""Bad, bad, Mama."" Soliloquy placed her head in her hands and openly sobbed.   ""Baby? Is he dead?"" Mama needed to know.  ""I don't know, Mama. I just don't know."" Soliloquy was racked with sobs.  ""Baby, this isn't your fault. I was hoping it wouldn't get this bad. I was hoping it'd would never go this far. This is something you just can't control. There's no way you can when you get older. It happened to me, too."" Mama said without realizing she'd just turned Soliloquy's world upside down.  What did she mean it happened to her, too? Wait, what?  ""Mama? What do you mean it happened to you?"" Soliloquy was certain she'd feel better once she talked to Mama but she most definitely was not feeling better.  ""Soliloquy, you've had these spells every since you were born. Well? Before you were born? I had them.""   Mama had the spells when she was younger, too?   ""I was born like you. I had spells from time to time and it was usually out of my control until I got older. I learned how to self soothe so nothing really bad happened. I thought it was all okay. I really did. Well, when I met your Daddy? I thought I'd never have another spell, again. I really did. I loved him so much. In the beginning? He was good to me, too. Then? Bethany. She just had to come along and screw it up. She was so much prettier and thinner than me and your Daddy just fell head over heels. I was crushed. I was devastated. How can I compete with skinny ass Methany? What could I do to make sure your Daddy stayed with me? Well, I thought of what women have thought of since time immemorial. I got pregnant. Your Daddy was happy at first. He really wanted you. As time went on? I got bigger and more unattractive as I got further along. Pregnancy isn't normally when a woman looks her best. Well, that just made your horn dog Daddy run to Bethany even more. I was losing him and couldn't do a thing about it. One day? A few weeks before I was due to have you? Your Daddy came to me and informed me that he's moving in with Bethany. He said he wanted nothing further to do with me and would see me in court over visitation and support. He very much wanted to be in your life, but not mine. Well, who in the hell does he think he is? I'll be damned if he's coming to see you but doesn't want me! So? As he stood at the bottom step of our front porch? Flames started licking his workboots and he screamed. I just laughed with delight the whole time he was burning up! When I had you? The ""spells"" moved onto you and left me."" Mama just smiled at Soliloquy like she just told her what the weather was like outside.   Soliloquy's head was spinning. Mama killed Daddy because he only wanted me and not her? No. NO! THAT'S NOT IT!  ""Mama, you just got mad and it got away from you, right?"" Soliloquy hoped she said yes.  ""Oh, no, Baby. The second he told me he wanted you but not me? I crisped him like bacon!"" Mama laughed. She actually laughed.   Soliloquy didn't know how to get out of this. Mama actually KILLED her Daddy. She never got to meet him. She never got to love him. She'd never known anything more than the crappy little podunk town she'd been born and raised in. She could've known more. She could've known nicer. She could've known better.  ""What's the matter, Baby? You look unhappy."" Was Mama actually serious? What's the matter? WHAT'S THE MATTER? SHE HAS GOT TO BE KIDDING!  It started happening. The flames licked onto the outside of the trailer and climbed up its walls and doors.  ""Soliloquy! What are you doing? Why are you burning up the trailer? Stop it this instant!"" Now Mama was the one angry.  ""No, Mama, I can't do that. You wanted me all to yourself. Well? Here I am. Both of us can head down to hell together."" Soliloquy looked at her with a sinister smile. It was then she just had to laugh. Sesame Street was on the T.V. behind Mama sobbing. Guess Grover got the last laugh after all.",scarystories,0,2023-06-13 17:20:35
The shelter,148l92y,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148l92y/the_shelter/,TheFirstDeacon,"About 3 years ago I moved from a one hell hole into another, for context though the next flat I moved into was actually in a good area and it looked better than the last two places I'd lived in lived.  For the first two months everything was calm, I could come home after work and sleep without any problem, until my neighbours dog would start barking and I mean atleast 7 hours a day this dog would be off on one.  Then it started people would come to his flat and bang like hell on his door now partly I felt the need to be a responsible neighbour and call the police in order to keep him safe I mean this was an old man.  I was wrong, about a month of crap and me calling the police ended up in this old man breaking into my place, at first I didn't really notice due to drinking a little too much but things like underwear and other stuff went missing I didn't really put two and two together until I had a sober month, that's when I put up a camera.  It wasn't until a few more months later I started to realise this camera wouldn't pick up dark 'shiny' clothing until one day after an evening shift I came home and sat in my chair in pure darkness I could hear something shuffling near the front door.  (My flat had one door the front door and only windows at the front, one big window and a small window, welcome to basement flats in the UK I guess)  As I sat and listened trying to work out if it was just my mind playing tricks I mustered up the courage and banged on the wall of the hallway so I could see who was moving around or doing whatever the dog, a white akaita ran off first then the person.  I still don't know what the hell he was doing but I have my theories.  I confronted him the next day whilst angry and sober to no avail, he tried lying and saying he wasn't home.  I let it go up until I came home one day and there was a strange smell in my flat and I noticed the window in the bottom left corner had been jarred open.  I have a few thoeries as to what he was up to but it wasn't something I was interested in, it wasn't until I put a camera clock in my room I got the evidence I needed I saw him creeping through my room and sniffing and masturbating in my room, it made me feel sick but unfortunately there was no way to identify him due to him wearing a mask.  I knew it was him, from past interactions I just knew it was him.  One night I lost my temper and threatened him with a blank firing pistol (legal in the UK)  That night is the night I ended up in prison, now as scared as I was it wasn't overly bad being locked away for 22 hours a day it gives you time to think which will either send you crazy or change you, it changed me I hope for the better.  When I was finally released they told me I had nowhere to go, nowhere to live even though my licence conditions stated I needed a stable address to go to.  For around a month I kept to myself, hidden in the shadows of the city, in the loneliest of places, no friends, no family to help, I considered suicide, attacking people I considered a lot of things until I broke and I reached out to the salvation army I was tired of being wet, cold and I knew I smelt like shit especially after the McDonald's staff kicked me out.  They told me they had no spaces and put me in contact with the shelter, a group who provides winter accommodation temporarily, I agreed desperately, they picked a group of us up around 1600 and moved us into a building after about a 45 min drive I was disorientated due to the long drive.  Everything was ok to be honest a shower, a cooker, yeah you had to clean and yeah you had to cook for yourself I had no problem with that I've lived on my own for multiple years, I had no issue with that.  It was around a month later I'd finally been offered a job with a recruitment agency I was over the moon and I just went with but the caretaker of the building began to take interest in me for some reason, at first I just shrugged it off as him just making sure everything was ok until one day he knocked on my door and offered me food.  I took it happily without thinking anything, when your homeless and someone offers you food you kinda take it without question.  It wasn't until around two weeks later I started to question everything I started having these weirdos shakes and I felt like I was going through withdrawal of some sorts but I don't drink that much and I don't do drugs.  I started researching the shakes and what I found out was that if you eat human flesh you can experience similar effects.  I decided to investigate further before pointing the finger, one night I ended up staying up because I just could sleep so I snuck downstairs to the kitchen only to peer through the door and see the cook Vasili cutting up a body I cupped my hand over my mouth to stifle my gasp and quickly moved back to my room, I moved out of there last week and the stories I've heard all lead to the same conclusion they are feeding the homeless to the homeless, this is the first time I've shared this part of my story due to being scared they may be watching.  Somebody help me.",scarystories,5,2023-06-13 13:50:15
The Windows to the Soul: Shiloh's Final Battle,148sc2m,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148sc2m/the_windows_to_the_soul_shilohs_final_battle/,Thick_Mick_Chick," It'd been a busy week. She'd practically begged the clock to go faster at work this afternoon, knowing full well she had the weekend off. Being a police dispatcher? You needed those ""mental health breaks"" that so many sing virtues about. It'd been a rough mental health week, for sure.  Tish recognized the number on the caller I.D. lt was Ol Shiloh. He'd been a paratrooper in Vietnam, and he came back stateside without so much of a scratch on him physically. Mentally? He saw ""gooks"" (Ol Shiloh's completely politically incorrect term for the Viet Cong as well as the eponymous Charlie) at the bottom of the basement stairs and in the shower waiting for him to enter the bathroom. As a little girl, Tish knew Ol Shiloh had a good heart but a feeble mind. His visual and auditory hallucinations made him the laughing stock of many of Eerie's child residents who pointed, snickered, and rolled their finger at the side of their temple, indicating he was crazier than a shithouse rat. Ol Shiloh sounded legitimately scared when he called, though. This was not an emotion Tish was familiar with. Nothing rattled Ol Shiloh even with his advanced case of post-traumatic stress disorder. He'd known Tish's parents, and? Oddities aside? Ol Shiloh was a good man. So? Speaking to him had never presented a challenge until today, and, Oh, what a challenge it was...  ""Eerie 911. Will this be police, fire, or medical?"" Tish had picked up on the 2nd ring. ""Ginny? Ginny Lynn? Is that you? "" The normally loquacious Shiloh queried.  ""Shiloh? Hey! Is everything okay?"" Tish inquired. Tish was the nickname given to her by her boyfriend, Craig, who Ginny never called by that name. His nickname was Gomez. They were the local Halloween decorating contest champions and adored everything scary, thus the nicknames given to each: Gomez and Morticia from Addams family fame. ""Naw, Ginny girl. Ain't okay at all."" Ol Shiloh was not himself. ""What's happening?"" Tish's mounting concern was palpable.  ""Nothing right now. It was last night."" Ol Shiloh spoke, barely above a whisper.  Remaining ever so patient, Tish replied, ""What happened last night, Shiloh? You don't sound like yourself, and it's worrying me."" ""Ginny, don't you worry your pretty lil head about me. Harry & Virginia did a fine job raising you. Guess it didn't take in your lil sister, considering she turned out to be the town doorknob. Everybody's had a turn at that girl."" Granted, Ol Shiloh was never known to mince his words, but this was strong even for him. What was even worse? He wasn't wrong. Time to get him reigned back in. ""Well, I don't think you called to talk to me about my sister's promiscuity. What's going on with you, Shiloh?"" Tish was sensing his reluctance to just ""spit it out. "" It was as if he was having 2nd thoughts about placing the call to begin with.  ""I had visitors last night."" Shiloh barely spoke above a whisper. ""Visitors?"" Tish queried. Ol Shiloh never had visitors. Hell, he'd been living all by himself every since Rose died. His saintly wife was married to him 50 years, only a month before she passed away from a fatal heart attack. To say Ol Shiloh was lost? That was an understatement. Shiloh was nothing without Rose. He met her in August of 68, right after he came back stateside from Vietnam in May of that same year. It was love at 1st sight for Ol Shiloh, but Rose needed convincing. She mistakenly thought Shiloh was ""a Mama's boy"" because he worshipped the ground Rose walked on. He was not. He was simply in love for the 1st and last time. Tish was really surprised with how well Ol Shiloh was able to pull through the 2nd roughest time in his life with the aid of Eerie's townsfolk. And? As Elton John famously quoted? When it comes to Ol Shiloh? I'm still standing. This? This was different. This was not the Shiloh she'd known for the last 53 years of her life. ""Ginny, they were kids. Well, they looked like kids, but..."" Ol Shiloh trailed off. He shut down again. ""Looked like kids? What made you think they weren't kids, Shiloh?"" Tish was nervous and ancy. This felt wrong. Something was off. ""There were 2 of them. A boy, dark hair, pale skin, and probably about 12 years old. He had a lil girl with him about 7, also dark hair & pale skin."" Shiloh was intrepid. Tish quietly listened as Gomez and some of the other deputies were laughing in the office behind her. She gave them a scornful look, and the guys piped down. ""They'd knocked at my front door about an hour after the sun went down. I didn't have the porch light on. The screen door was shut and locked, but the wooden door was open. I turned the porch light on so I could see them better. They were both looking down at their feet. The boy whispered something but I couldn't hear, so I asked him to speak up,"" Shiloh let the flood gates burst forward. ""Sir? May we use your phone? We've gotten lost and are scared. We need to call our mother. Please, let us in."" The dark-haired boy requested.  ""I've not seen you kids around here before in my life. Who's your parents?"" Shiloh knew everyone in Eerie, Indiana, but he'd never seen these odd looking kids.  ""Sir? Please, let us in. We need to call our mother. She'll be so worried."" The dark-haired boy practically recited word for word what he'd already previously said, which really riled Shiloh up. ""Boy, you deaf?"", I asked, ""Who's your folks?"" Shiloh continued to give Tish the play by play. ""Sir? Please. We are cold. We are hungry and we are scared. Please, let us in."" The dark-haired boy sounded rehearsed and mechanical.  ""NO! There's something not right here."" Ol Shiloh didn't survive a hot tour in the jungle because he didn't have good instincts. ""Sir, please, if you could just let us in."" The little dark-haired girl then chimed in. Ol Shiloh knew instinctively not to trust these 2 but found himself being drawn to them paradoxically. His hand reached for the storm door to open it even though every fiber in his being told him not to. ""What the hell are you kids cause you ain't human?!"" Ol Shiloh was more nervous now than when he was a tunnel rat. Both children looked up and to Shiloh simultaneously. What he saw scared him worse than any night he'd spent in jungle. Their eyes were black, not just the pupil. The Iris, cornea, and pupil were all black but not just any black. The deepest black, pure obsidian. The answers to all of the galaxy's most burning questions were in those pitch black bottomless depth eyes.  ""Shiloh Svengaard, let us IN!"" both children stared into Shiloh's pale milky blue eyes as he stared back into their black ones. ""NO. NO, NOW GO AWAY!"" Shiloh slammed the wooden door and locked it. He watched as the black eyed children walked to the end of his driveway and onto James Dean Boulevard. They went off into the night and Ol Shiloh didn't see them anymore. ""So, you thought they'd return?"" Tish was a tad overwhelmed. Ol Shiloh had audio and visual hallucinations but it was always fellow soldiers, the Viet Cong or the North Vietnamese Army. It sure as hell wasn't black eyed tweens.  ""Ginny girl, I don't think they'll return. I know it. They're coming for me. I know they are."" Delusions of persecution certainly isn't anything new to Tish when it came to Ol Shiloh but this was different. Shiloh was full of doubt and self defeat. Never in his life had Ol Shiloh backed down from a fight. This? This was uncharted territory. ""Want Don to swing by on patrol tonight? Craig and I are having a lil evening out so he won't be on. Don would be glad to do it, Shiloh. Really."" Comforting and reassuring Ol Shiloh was Tish's main concern at the moment.  ""Yeah, Ginny Girl. Have Don cruise by my place if he would. Maybe a patrol car will keep these evil fucking little bastards away from me and my house. Best part of those lil sons a bitches dripped down their Mama's leg when she was getting pregnant with 'em!"" Ol Shiloh always had a way with words. ""Okay. I'll tell him but remember to use the non emergency line next time, Shiloh. Can't tie 911 up with non emergent calls."" Tish gently scolded. ""Fuck that non emergency number, Ginny girl! It prompts me to press 1 for English and 2 for the ESPENOIL (pronounced ESPN OIL) and bullshit! I just call 911 and get ahold of you!"" Shiloh wasn't about to call an automated line. That just wasn't how he did things. Tish was the one that could handle his problems. She was the good sister. ""Okay, okay, Shiloh. I'll tell Don. You just take it from me. Rose wouldn't want to see you like this."" Tish was truly concerned. ""Ginny girl, my Rosie can't see anything anymore."" And with that? He hung up the phone. The guys were still hanging out in the office, albeit much quieter.  ""Sorry 'bout that. We didn't know you were on the phone. We wouldn't have been telling jokes if we knew you were on the phone."" Gomez sheepishly looked down at the table where he was seated with 2 other deputies, Don & Bubba.  ""It wouldn't have mattered. Ol Shiloh was ranting so much he didn't even hear you guys."" Tish dismissed. ""Ol Shiloh? What put a hair across his ass?"" Don asked. ""He said 2 kids came by last night about an hour after dark, wanting to be let in the house. He was uncharacteristically afraid. He said they just kept repeating to let them in so they could call their mother. He felt something was off, something wasn't right."" Tish trailed off. ""Kids? Whose kids?"" Gomez spoke up.  ""He didn't know. He even asked the kids who their parents were but they just kept asking to come in the house."" Tish replied. ""Anyway, he said when he really got scared was when both kids looked up at him and their eyes were black. Their eyes were completely black."" Tish kept relaying everything Ol Shiloh told her. Gomez, Don & Bubba looked at her as if she'd grown a 2nd head. ""I'm just telling you what he said."" Tish defended. ""When he saw those black eyes? He panicked, slammed and locked the wooden door and told them to go away. They did."" Tish finished. ""So what does Lt. Dan want us to do with a couple of kids with colored contacts pranking the local crazy Vietnam Vet?"" Don sighed. ""I offered for you to swing by his place on patrol tonight. He was pleased with that."" Tish informed. ""FFS. Fine. Bubba and I can swing by a few times tonight as long as it shuts that old crazy bastard up."" Don resigned to his fate. ""You know, Don? No one will ever accuse you of being too caring."" Tish just rolled her eyes. ""BTW? What was the joke you guys were laughing at?"" Tish suddenly remembered.  ""There was a young Indian warrior who asked the tribe's chief one day how he decided on all of the babies' names when they were born since he was given the honor of naming all of the children""... Bubba began. ""He said, ""My son, if there is an eagle flying over when a child is being born? I call that child Eagle Flying Over. If there is snow gently falling when a child is being born? I call that child Snow Gently Falling, but tell me, Two Dogs Fucking, why do you ask?"" Bubba finished to a 2nd round of uproarious laughter. ""For Christ's sake, Bubba. You ain't got a lick of sense!"" Gomez wiped a tear of laughter from his eye and proceeded to leave he and Don in charge while he and Tish left for the day.  They got into the SUV and headed towards the Blue Bayou Creole restaurant. Most quaint and quirky hometowns have that one little restaurant everyone loves. The Blue Bayou was Eerie, Indiana's version. The seafood buffet on Friday nights were always a hit. As much as Tish & Gomez were home bodies? They did enjoy an occasional night at the Blue Bayou.  Bubba and Don drank coffee and told more dirty jokes. Swinging by Ol Shiloh's place a few times tonight will help break up the monotony. Poor ol bastard didn't mean any harm. He was just messed up in the head. Kids with all black eyes? What the hell was that all about, anyway?  Ol Shiloh really wanted to believe Tish. He really did. He knew, deep down inside, if Ginny, Craig and the boys at Eerie PD couldn't help him? No one could. Well, he has his shot gun on the rack, but who would threaten to shoot children? He saw enough of that shit cleaning out villages of their denizens back in jungle. He never intended to live that kind of hell, again. Strange looking kids or not, they still at least looked like kids. He just couldn't bring himself to shoot a child.  He was nodding off in his recliner. The sun was dipping below the horizon.  Tish & Gomez sat and ate and caught up with the day's activities. ""Ol Shiloh was really that scared, huh?"" Gomez asked Tish in a low voice so others couldn't overhear. ""Yeah. Yeah, he was. It was unsettling."" Tish was clearly still bothered. ""I'll remind Don later on tonight when I check in, I promise."" Gomez reassured. ""Please, do. I've never heard fear in his voice before. It's really got me shook."" Tish slowly relaxed and let the stress melt away as she took another spoonful of gumbo. ""Consider it done."" Gomez smiled and began eating as well.  Was it a knock? He couldn't be sure. The house was dark but Shiloh knew his own home. He slowly got up from the recliner and proceeded to the door. Could it be? He hoped not. Even as much as he knew those little demons were going to return? He had really hoped he'd be wrong. One quick look through the glass of the wooden door proved he was not. There they were: same dark-haired pale boy and girl but there was something different this time. There was a 3rd party out there but the darkness prevented him from making out who it was. This 3rd party was taller and bigger, clearly an adult but that was the only clear thing.  ""Please, Shiloh, let us in. We're cold. We're hungry. Our mother is worried."" Both children said in unison. The 3rd party waited in the wings.  ""I don't know you little mother fuckers so how did you know my name?"" Shiloh raged. He was still scared but more angry now.   ""Rosie told us."" Both children simultaneously chirped happily.  Wait, what? Rosie? Rosie as in my Rosie? The Rosie I cruelly lost just 4 January's ago? ""ROSIE? What the hell you mean Rosie?"" Ol Shiloh thought that he'd lost what little mind he had left. Just then? Something happened that flipped Ol Shiloh's world upside down.   ""Shiloh Shenandoah? Is that you, my love?"" Rosie. It was Rosie. Bigger than shit, it was his beloved wife of over 50 years. How, though? It couldn't be. He saw her on the slab in the morgue when he had to identify her. It couldn't be. She was 4 years in the ground! Yet, there she stood behind the black eyed children looking at him with the same set of obsidian black eyes.  ""Rosie? That can't be you. You died a month after our 50th wedding anniversary! You've been gone 4 years!"" Ol Shiloh's mind was reeling and he didn't know what to do.   ""Don't you love me, anymore, my dear? I thought you'd be so happy to see me."" Rosie smiled a smile that would have otherwise been beautiful if it weren't sitting below 2 pitch black eyes.   ""Don't ask silly questions, Rosie. You're the only one for me. You always have been. You always will be."" Shiloh was opening the screen door. The dark-haired pale children grabbed the storm door from the other side and pulled, Rosie with her sinister grin and black eyes moved forward.   ""Let us in, Shiloh."" The children and Rosie crossed the threshold and, immediately afterwards? Shiloh let out a scream coming from the death throws. As painful as it was? At least the ripping out of his throat by the children's mouths was, mercifully, quick.  ""Bubba! You are one redneck, peckerwood cracker!"" Don rolled his eyes as he drove along at a steady pace patrolling. ""You know I'm right! You just don't want to admit it!"" Bubba was getting equally irritated with Don in his response. Don's wife, Allison, was, indeed, Tish's little sister. She was also ""the town doorknob"" as Old Shiloh not so eloquently called her. She was well known to everyone as Eerie's town slut even though she married Don 10 years ago. Guess it's true what the song says, you can't turn a ho into a housewife.  ""Dude, I know you love her but she's always gonna be the town whore, Man"" Bubba tried backpedaling at least some.  ""Will you shut up? Will you just shut the fuck up? I'm tired of hearing this shit!"" Don lost it and blew up on Bubba. Bubba, in turn, shut down and stopped speaking.  They rolled onto James Dean Boulevard and proceeded to Ol Shiloh's place. It was dark, lonely and isolated. Shiloh was never one for neighbors, but something seemed even more off. Something just didn't seem right. Isn't that what Tish described earlier when Shiloh spoke to her on the phone? She said she heard fear. They'd never known Ol Shiloh to be fearful. Today? All of that changed.  Don & Bubba slowly crept up Shiloh's long driveway. Don tried rolling the spotlight on the cruiser up onto Shiloh's front porch. It was still a weak beam of light but was getting brighter. ""What the fuck?"" Don hit the brakes. ""What is it?"" Bubba looked at Don like he was absolutely crazy. ""The door is open. Actually? Both of them are."" Don shone the spotlight onto the open screen and wooden doors. They could tell both doors were open but could see nothing else due to the darkness.   ""I don't like this, Bubba."" Don was intrepid and softly pressed on the accelerator.   ""Don, should we call Tish & Gomez? I mean, I know it's their night out but..."" Bubba trailed off.  They sat in the driveway next to Ol Shiloh's porch. Other than both front doors being open? They couldn't see a thing.   Don and Bubba slowly approached the porch, guns drawn. It was dark but something was lying just inside the open front doors. As they advanced? It was boots. Jump boots that had a high polish shine. Those boots were connected to legs. Shiloh's legs.  ""Jesus Christ, call for a bus!"" Don yelled for Bubba to radio in for an ambulance.  Shiloh laid at the entrance to his home, flat on his back, staring with dead cold wide open eyes straight to and through the ceiling. A look of abject horror plastered all over his face. His throat was ripped out almost to his spinal cord.  ""Oh, God, I'm gonna puke!"" Bubba ran back outside where the evening's coffee went all over the sidewalk.  ""Call the coroner, too. This is gonna be a God damn circus!"" Don didn't attempt to get a pulse considering Shiloh's carotid arteries and jugular veins had been viciously ripped out.   Bubba wiped his mouth and started calling all of the necessary people. Don stood next to Shiloh with his hands holding his head in disbelief.  ""Our 1st kill was a success."" The dark-haired pale boy said to the creature that looked like Rosie.   ""It was this time. We must improve. We must refine. If we don't evolve? We wither and die. What would the point be to just stop at the 1st kill? The colony could never advance if we never pursued other avenues to further our agenda."" The creature that looked like Rosie opined.  The dark-haired pale boy and girl nodded in sync with everything the creature that looked like Rosie said. Is this how their occupation of Terra was really going to commence? Given everything the Alliance taught them? They thought the humans would be more violent and aggressive. Perhaps? The distant study of the  Terrestrials proved incorrect in practice in comparison to theory. Perhaps the Terrestrials will gladly cease resistance when they realize just how futile it will be.

The bully of our school bullied the newbie. He was not human...,148c3cd,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148c3cd/the_bully_of_our_school_bullied_the_newbie_he_was/,scare_in_a_box,"Some time ago, a new boy arrived at the school. As was the custom with all newcomers, the school bully approached him. He was a skinny boy, with brown-rimmed glasses, somewhat disheveled hair, and loose clothing: the perfect target. Not only for Thomas, the biggest bully in school, but also for everyone else.      Thomas stood in front of him, arms folded and a crooked smile on his face. The new boy stared at him for a long moment, saying nothing, until Thomas took his arm in one of his huge hands.      ""I'll explain how things work around here, new,"" he said. ""You give me part of your money, I protect you.""      The new boy didn't say anything, just stared at him. By that time, we were all watching the situation closely. Many smiled, complicit; others were scared; some rolled their eyes, knowing how it would all end: no matter how much the new guy refused at first, he would end up giving the bully money.      However, to everyone's surprise, the new boy disappeared. Thomas's fingers, which had been holding the boy's skinny arm, were left holding the very air. The bully looked everywhere, not understanding what was happening.      ""What—?!"" he started to scream, but was interrupted by a loud crack.      Immediately afterwards, and to the astonishment of the entire school, a metallic contraption appeared around Thomas. It looked like a cage, only one side was not made of bars, but a smooth metal plate. Thomas had been hooked to the metal at the wrists and ankles, through metal handcuffs that protruded from the bars opposite the plate. From one of the corners of the apparatus stick out a gigantic drill, which was pointed directly at Thomas's chest.      The bully tried to get free, without any success. Many of us, including me, came to take a closer look at the device. One of the girls screamed, discovering that the new boy's face was etched into the metal plate: his face was very clear, sticking out of the metal, his eyes closed.      A new crack startled us all, causing us to walk away. The drill turned on and began to slowly approach Thomas. The sharp point aiming straight into the middle of his chest... into his heart.      Thomas began to yell and move more, desperate to get away. Many started laughing, others just stared, a couple ran outside to call the teachers. I, for my part, began to walk around the device to see how it was set up and if there was any way to turn off the drill. Thomas was a bully, I myself had been bullied by him for years, but that didn't mean I wanted him to get hurt. Or dead... because if that drill reached his chest, it would kill him, that was for sure.      A couple of teachers showed up within a few minutes. Some of the boys began to yell, joining in on Thomas's yelling.      ""Professor,"" I said, moving closer to one of them, ""I think if we unscrew those things, we can get him out."" I pointed out some gigantic screws, metallic like the rest of the structure, that protruded from it and seemed to keep it assembled.      The professor looked at me, then looked at the structure and nodded. ""I'll get some screwdrivers,"" he said, and ran off.      As we waited, we all watched in horror as the drill moved closer and closer to Thomas's body. The bully was still squirming, and he had started sobbing like a baby. Many guys laughed at this. Most of us, however, were now more concerned than amused.      The new boy's face was still there, in the metallic silver, impassive and with his eyes closed, as if he were a punishing god.      The drill was already halfway through when the professor arrived with the screwdrivers. I took one. Several more took others. All together we began to try to remove the screws.      They were so big and so locked that it took incredible force to move them even an inch. The vibration of the drill and Thomas's crying and struggling were not helping the overall situation.      ""Thomas,"" the professor said at one point, ""we need you to calm down. We'll get you out of there, don't worry. But please don't move.""      The bully nodded. Tears streamed down his face and he kept his eyes closed, so he wouldn't look at the drill.      The screw that I was removing was halfway. The drill was several inches from Thomas's body and for a moment I panicked. What would happen if we didn't get it out in time? What explanation would we give? It would be a disaster, that's for sure. Not just for Thomas's family and the school, but for everyone. I couldn't even imagine what it must be like to watch someone get pierced by a screw spinning at full speed. The entire hallway would be drenched in blood and... other things I didn't even want to think about.      I shook my head, trying to push those thoughts away, and turned my attention back to the screw. I twisted and pulled with all the strength I had, causing the screw to come out a little more. At that moment, one of the teachers managed to remove one of the screws, which fell to the floor with a metallic noise that startled us all. The other teacher was already close to removing another. I was in the middle, and the other boys were in situations similar to mine.      But Thomas didn't have that much time. The drill was dangerously close to his body, to his chest. When the second screw fell, both teachers began to help with the others.      Thomas's eyes narrowed, and seeing how close he was to death, he gave a desperate squeal and began to move in all directions.      ""Thomas, calm down!"" yelled one of the teachers.      The third and fourth screws fell to the ground. There were only two left. One of them, mine. The teachers went to help, as well as the other boys. The bully's scream filled the hallway, the drill was very close.      The fifth screw fell.      Thomas was still yelling. The drill seemed to be already touching the leather jacket he was wearing.      The professor and I gave the last pull; the sixth and final screw fell to the floor.      The metal holding Thomas in place split open and he fell to his knees, shivering. He covered his face with his hands and began to cry again.      The teachers went to help him. Almost automatically, I looked at the drill: it had stopped.      The teachers helped the bully to his feet and took him away, trying to calm him down. The rest of us stayed and watched the device, which began to vanish into thin air, as mysteriously as it had appeared.      No one ever saw the new guy again. Nobody even remembers his name, if he ever said it. The teachers don't know who he was...apparently there was no transfer scheduled for that day.      Thomas is no longer a bully.",scarystories,1,2023-06-13 06:24:42
Do Not Follow It Home,148go4u,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148go4u/do_not_follow_it_home/,LilHeartFailure,"So I live in a relatively new house in the neighborhood. It's a few minutes off the interstate and the last house on the end of a long, winding road in my neighborhood. I got the house about a month ago now. It was awfully cheap for such a relatively nice neighborhood and such a new house. Every night going home from my work across the city has been an amazing drive. The interstate is empty, the houses all the way up to mine have gone to bed, and the roads are silent. The only bad thing is how empty it can feel. The lights in my half of the neighborhood have been off for a little under a week now and it's quite frightening to say the least.          Today however, something peculiar happened. I want to get these words out to someone before something happens to me. I was driving from work. It had been relatively the same drive until about 10 or so minutes until my exit from the interstate. A blue, greenish sedan entered into the interstate just in front of me. I wasn't first off scared but it was odd as it was the first car I'd ever seen on my way back home in the night. It was going about the same speed as me and I didn't care to pass it. As I saw their blinker turn to get into the same exit as me I felt off. It's like I already knew what was going to happen. And sure enough they turned a few minutes later into my same neighborhood entrance, down the same long and dark road, and into my driveway. Yes, my driveway. Let me say to you, whoever reads this, if this happens to you turn around and leave. I am truly scared of what might happen.           I parked right behind them and waited for a moment. Their car was off with no light inside. I was scared maybe I accidentally zoned out and followed this poor soul home but no, my address read clearly on the house. So again, I was this poor soul. I got out of my car and began to briskly walk into my sheltering home, only briefly glancing towards my strange visitor's car Yet, no one remained inside. As I got to my door I fumbled my keys, hearing a noise behind me, not walking, but scratching along the pavement as it drew closer and closer, rather slowly. Finally, the key was inside the lock and turned letting me sigh in relief and forcing myself into the dark house and quickly shutting it and locking it behind me.           I almost instantly forgot about the situation and began to do my normal routine. Fix a small snack, shower, and whatnot. I got into my bed and laid there, thinking back on all the madness that happened. In my sudden remembrance of fear I quickly arose and turned on my desk light across the room, taking my phone back to my bed with me. And that's when it started.           The scratching sound. Like  clawing at the door to my seemingly safe house. Then silence. My relief was instantly killed when I heard the dragging, scratching noise against my hardwood floors. I heard pictures fall and clash as it crept slowly towards my room. And that's where I am now. Quickly writing this to warn someone as it begins to scratch at my door. As it now goes silently as it did before, and as my light on the other side of my room darkens. I shiver in fear here. Please all I ask of you. DO. NOT. FOLLOW. IT. HOME.",scarystories,4,2023-06-13 10:25:57
It's there...,148d6yu,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148d6yu/its_there/,panterium,"My dad had bought a house straight up for cash just out on a whim, he had suprised me and my two other siblings so it was a step up from the slums for sure, he came across some money which he won't explain and I shouldnt care how so but that's not the point.   All he told us was that the house was for cheap and got a good deal for it, the only catch was that it needed some repair work, as my dad was carpenter, he could fix it up no problem at all, it was his thing.  I being the older child of the three, I had a help in it and I wasn't to bad at it myself.  It took a few months to complete the work since I was still in school so it became a weekend project for the two of us while the young ones played and did their own thing.  My brother Tim was always the goofy one and always laughing, playing practical jokes and was the laugh of the family, always wanted to be a comedian as he says.  But he started to change after the first month we moved in and did the work, his jokes became less and less and he grew mean to our youngest sister, he began to swear and have random out bursts, fits of rage that would land him in trouble with our father, of course he would be disciplined and had his toys taken away which would just make things worse.  We had no clue as to why he was acting this way, his health started to drop and even so we asked why he was being like this, there were a few times he would seem like he wanted to speak up and tells us but he would just stop mid sentence throw a fit.  One night as our father was out working late, I was with the kids and Tim started to act up, I called my father cause this anger was becoming destructive like never before.  It didn't take long for our father to get home and when he did he found tim sitting on his bed which was pushed away from the wall and seen he had been attacking one certain spot on the wall, scratches and dents along with red markings from his crayons drawn in circles could be seen.  My father managed to calm him down as he cried uncontrollablely in his arms, I stood against the door frame watching the whole thing and something told me that he was trying to tell us something.  That weekend I suggested that the youngins be sent to our aunts for the night and dad agreed.  He seemed alright at my aunt's or so she says, he was his normal self and was happy to hear that.  When I knew me and dad were alone, I went down to the shed and grabbed a sledgehammer as he watched what I was about to do, he looked at me like I was crazy as I took the first swing ""what the hell are you doing boy?!""  I looked at him and kept swinging till there was a two foot hole in the wall, I pulled out another foot of dry wall off and grabbed a flashlight.   Dad stood over my shoulder as I shined the light into the darkness and we both instantly stepped back in fear.  My dad pulled me back and he grabs a hug piece of the wall and ripped it back along with some pieces of wood and that's where it was... A mummified hand falls out with three fingers curled and the index finger pointed out.  We pulled the rest of the wall back to find the rest of the body and found it had been a female... Dad immediately called the cops and they came with a forensic team to investigate everything which took a few days, turns out that the woman had been murdered in Tim's room and her remains were sealed.  What really disturbed me was that the fact her hand, her pointing finger was right where Tim's head would be when he slept.  When we asked him about what was going on with him, he didn't hesitate to tell us ""the woman in my wall talks to me, she kept tapping on the wall when I tried to sleep but she wouldn't stop! She won't stop until I helped her but I couldn't tell anyone, she choked me.""  We never knew anything even as he tried to tell us, that was the cause of his outbursts and acting differently.   As we grew up Tim just kind of forgotten the whole thing and we never mentioned it, we moved out of the house soon after that and everything went back to normal, me and dad brought it up sometimes but that's it, we never knew how that woman was killed or who did it, we were just glad Tim is ok and we're out of that house.

The Windows to the Soul: The Venerate Syndicate,148sjbj,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148sjbj/the_windows_to_the_soul_the_venerate_syndicate/,Thick_Mick_Chick,"Note: This is Part 4   Part 1: Shiloh's Final Battle   Part 2: Allie's Assimilation   Part 3: Alliance of Alliances     ""NO! NO! IT CAN'T BE!,"" Ozymandius screamed.   ""Ozymandius?! What is it?"" Kleeta was concerned.   ""The youngling was born way too soon! It also killed it's Terrian mother and that fool she married!"" Ozymandius was beside himself. How? Venerate and his docile nature were sure to make the second generation Belammina the best and last resolution. They'd gone over everything in finite detail. The Vanguard, Alliance and Venerate were foolproof, or so they ascertained.    ""Ozymandius?"" Kleeta approached.   ""WHY DID THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN, AGAIN?"" Ozymandius couldn't focus on answering Kleeta. What now? Was it too late?   Kleeta took Ozymandius' face in her hands and looked into his eyes, where tears were streaming down by this point. ""We have the option of going to Terra and assessing the situation before the Vanguard & Alliance even find out that the youngling has been born to the Terrian whore."" How could Kleeta appear so kind with those demonic eyes? Ozymandius would never know.   ""Kleeta, if only we could..."" Kleeta already knew where Ozymandius was headed with this and it was pointless.   ""Don't say it, Ozymandius. It's forbidden for Atramentarians to mate with Belammina. Atramentarians don't even associate with Belammina, let alone marry them. It'd be better if..."" It was then Ozymandius grabbed and interrupted her. He pressed his lips against hers and gently glided his tongue in between. He tasted masculine, sweet and good. She returned the kiss with fervor. He was getting aroused.   ""Stop it, Ozymandius! We can't! It is forbidden and we will both suffer greatly for it! Have you forgotten how bad things were for us when you were overthrown with a coup d'état? You were unbearable, Ozymandius! I can't go through that, again!"" Kleeta pushed him back. His face looked like she'd just slapped him. He was crushed.   ""Kleeta? I love you. I cannot take you as my wife, per Atramentarian law. You know this as well as I do. They've restricted Belammina from being able to mate with Atramentarians the 'natural' way. They can only combine DNA under the strictest circumstances and in a sterile laboratory. They haven't stopped me from loving you. They never could."" Ozymandius took her hand into his. The flesh was soft to touch and cold. It was so pale white? It had tinges of blue. She refused to look up at him.   ""Kleeta, come with me. I won't hurt you. I never could. The Vanguard and Alliance will never know. We're getting ready to board the Rhombus to head to Terra. It takes 2 Terra days to even reach the Stygian Quadrant. It takes another Terra day to reach their planet."" Ozymandius led Kleeta onto the Rhombus. As the name indicates? Their vessel is not only diamond shaped? It's also made of them. The Rhombus has proven itself very effective. Running on centrifugal force? It's an energy source that is renewable wherever they travel so they never become stranded. To increase visibility? The Rhombus alternately blinks blue, red and green.    ""Ozymandius, we can't..."" Kleeta sat on the sleeper, watching him program Terra's destination into the Rhombus' system. When he finished? He turned to her.   ""Kleeta, it's okay. The Vanguard and Alliance will never know. It's just you and I for 3 Terra days. I want to thank you in a way I've never been able to before. How could they ever know? They won't."" Ozymandius walked towards her and gently smiled.   ""Ozymandius? I just know that it's wrong. I also know I love you, too. I just..."" Kleeta trailed off. She couldn't bring her eyes up from the floor    ""Kleeta, my love, we are safe. They'll never know. I'm so grateful they made conception limited to the labs. There's no proof. We won't be found out."" Ozymandius stood before Kleeta, bare naked and erect, but she wouldn't look up.   He was the one that took Kleeta's face into his hands this time. Her obsidian eyes traipsed slowly over his body. His skin was also soft and pale but it was a pretty color, a much nicer shade than Kleeta's corpse-like tone of bluish-white. He was fully aroused and anticipating Kleeta's response. He'd never force Kleeta into something she didn't want. That's just not how he did things. He'd manhandled many an Atramentarian Vanguard soldier but his Kleeta? Never could he ever hurt the only being that had truly accepted, supported and loved him when no one else even tolerated him.   Kleeta stood and unzipped the body suit she'd been wearing. She slipped her shoulders and arms out and let it fall to the floor. Ozymandius began kissing Kleeta, again. This time? Kleeta gave in fully. His hands caressed her face, shoulders, breasts  and down to her pelvic region. She, too, was as aroused as Ozymandius.    ""Lay down, My Heart, and allow me to show you all that you are to me and all I will ever be,"" Ozymandius gently guided Kleeta down onto the sleeper. She wasted no time spreading her legs and he entered without hesitation. She softly sighed and pulled him closer, she locked her legs around his body and they made love on and off for the 3 day trip to Terra.   Gomez and Tish had just woken up when Gomez's city issued phone started ringing, again. Gomez and Tish exchanged concerned glances.   ""Craig Oliver, Chief of Police, Eerie, Indiana,"" Gomez answered. Tish watched on, brow furrowed.    ""Hey, Craig. It's Adam Evans, Lawrence County Coroner."" Gomez surmised it must be in relation to Ol Shiloh Svengaard.    ""Hi, Adam. Is this about Ol Shiloh?"" Gomez inquired.    ""Unfortunately? It's about that and so much more,"" Adam wasn't even sure how to proceed with the cluster fuck of information that was getting ready to pour onto Gomez, ""Yeah, I've garnered more information on his case, but that isn't the priority right now.""   If a homicide in Eerie, Indiana didn't warrant the coroner calling? WTH else is? Gomez didn't like the sound of this at all. He had his phone on speaker. Tish was furiously wringing her hands, a habit she developed as a child when she was nervous.   ""We got a phone call from Kennedy this morning. He was frantic..."" Adam's voice trailed off in Gomez's head. Wait did he say Kennedy, the Eerie, Indiana version of Channing Tatum? If Kennedy and the coroner met this morning? That meant his ass needed to get into motion.    ""There's been an incident at the Donald & Allison Hoff residence at some point and time between late last night and very early this morning..."" Before Adam could utter another word? He cut him off.   ""Don is one of my officers and his wife, Allison, is my girlfriend, Tish's, sister."" Gomez was terrified of what Adam's next words were going to be...   ""Craig, I'm so sorry. Donald and Allison Hoff were attacked and murdered in their home at some point. I'm still trying to ascertain the time..."" Gomez dropped the phone as soon as he heard Tish scream. He flew towards her to try to grab her before she hit the floor. Unfortunately, he didn't make it. He hit his knees and scooped her into his arms. Tish was racked with sobs.   It wasn't like Tish had never considered the possibility that Allie would be murdered by one of her ""conquests"". She'd feared it for the majority of her life really. They'd tried talking to her every since she was a teen. It never worked. It never got through. Of course it wouldn't with Allie! Thank God Mom and Dad were gone and wouldn't have to endure this. Tish wasn't sure how she'd get through it. It was imperative that she had Gomez's support in her time of need. He also had her support in the loss of his fellow officer and friend.   The Rhombus spun down and on top of a large hill in the middle of a Lawrence County forested area. The vessel's door opened slowly as steam rose up from underneath the Rhombus. The debarking plank dropped and Ozymandius and Kleeta descended the ship. Ozymandius had programmed the Rhombus to get to Terra. The Rhombus, as advanced as it was, found an Einstein-Rosen bridge and was able to get them to Terra in hours instead of days. It didn't matter. Ozymandius thanked Kleeta several times during their journey, regardless.    ""Ozymandius? Where are they?"" Kleeta looked all over and saw no sign of Venerate and the 2 aberrations.    ""They knew where we landed. Venerate had the coordinates. My guess? They weren't anticipating our arrival so soon."" Ozymandius did make sense considering they, themselves,  thought it would take much longer to reach Terra.    The trees to the right softly glowed a bright green. Venerate and the 2 aberrations were approaching the Rhombus' landing zone.    ""Ozymandius, they're coming."" Kleeta pointed towards the woods.   Ozymandius and Kleeta saw the 2 aberrations and Venerate ascend the hill and approach them. Ozymandius took a deep breath. Kleeta sensed his distress. ""What happened, Venerate?"" Ozymandius didn't even wait for them to get all the way to him before he asked.    ""We don't know, yet, My Lord. The youngling came forth in a manner of hours after conception. There is no way we could have planned a contingency for this."" Venerate truly looked troubled. As difficult as it was to try to predict any kind of emotion by looking at him? Ozymandius definitely could tell by the tone of voice that Venerate was as troubled as he.   ""I know both of us spent years researching and studying past mistakes to ensure we'd have a minimal risk of failure. Not only have we failed, again? We've failed worse with the second Belammina trial than we did with the 1st,"" Ozymandius rubbed his temples to the sides of his strawberry blonde hair.    Venerate began to speak but the male aberration spoke up first, ""You're a fool and a coward! You shouldn't even be here! Kleeta should rule! Not you! She's superior, but Atramentarians fear what they don't know and they hate what they fear! You should have done the decent thing! If you were truly noble? You'd have committed Hari Kari instead of trying to recover a reputation that isn't tarnished. It's purely rusted!"" As soon as he finished? Both aberrations looked at Ozymandius anticipating a violent outburst with sinister smiles.   Before Ozymandius spoke? Kleeta stormed over to the male aberration and slapped him to the ground and also slapped the female aberration simply for agreeing with him. ""HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO YOUR LORD IN THAT MANNER!!!,"" Kleeta had never, in her entire life, struck anyone or shown any form of violence, even any sign of anger. Ozymandius and Venerate were stunned.   ""NEVER, AND I MEAN, NEVER SPEAK TO YOUR LORD IN THAT MANNER, AGAIN!"" Kleeta was beside herself in anger. The 2 aberrations just stared at Kleeta with disdain.  The male aberration stood up, brushing dirt, leaves and grass off.    ""You aren't suppose to strike your own kind, Kleeta. What would the Vanguard & Alliance say if I informed them?"" The 2 aberrations smiled diabolically, yet, again.   ""How can you tell them if you never make it back to Atramentous?"" Kleeta fired right back.   The smiles the 2 aberrations wore quickly faded. Ozymandius was stunned. He had never known Kleeta to stick up for herself, but she seemed to have no problem sticking up for him. ""Thank you, Kleeta."" Ozymandius squeaked out.    ""It is a duty, a duty both of them know they should have. You are still their Lord & Master, whether they want to recognize you as such or not!"" Kleeta was seething.   ""Apologies, Milord."" The male aberration sarcastically hissed. The female aberration stifled a giggle.    ""Watch it, Parasite!"" Kleeta warned.   ""Yes, well, now that we've moved past that? We need to locate the youngling before it destroys all of our well laid plans."" Venerate attempted to be the voice of reason.    ""When did you actually see it last?"" Ozymandius questioned Venerate.    ""The youngling slithered/climbed out the front door of it's mother's house."" Venerate replied.   ""You weren't able to get it?"" Ozymandius inquired.    ""No, My Lord. We really did try."" Venerate was also upset.   ""Do we have any way to track the youngling?"" Ozymandius was really desperate. If they could at least recover the youngling? The Alliance would never have to know. If that fucking male aberration doesn't keep his mouth shut? He most certainly won't be alive to tell the Vanguard and Alliance. From Kleeta's reaction? She may not wait that long.   ""Ozone probes for closer distances but the youngling could be anywhere."" Venerate was just as perplexed as Ozymandius.    Kleeta heard a distant voice, ""Mother?"", it hissed and sounded wet.   ""What was that?"" She looked around quizzically.    Ozymandius, Venerate and the 2 aberrations returned her quizzical look. ""What was what, Kleeta?"" Ozymandius asked, in return.    ""None of you heard that?"" Kleeta was extremely perplexed.    ""We hear nothing, Kleeta."" Ozymandius and Venerate said, in unison. The aberrations just stared at Kleeta, seething.   ""MOTHER?"" The youngling crawled up the hill towards Kleeta, hissing. The 2 aberrations moved to get the youngling before he could reach Kleeta, but Kleeta made it to the youngling before they did. ""STAY AWAY FROM HIM!"" Kleeta roared at the 2 aberrations. They stepped back, scowling.    ""That's strike 2, Maggot!"" Kleeta gritted her teeth as she simultaneously scooped up the youngling and glared at the aberrations.    ""Mother?"" The youngling nuzzled into Kleeta's breast and, promptly, fell asleep. Kleeta sighed with relief as did Ozymandius and Venerate.    ""WHY do you have it? Shouldn't OUR Lord have the youngling, Kleeta?"" The male aberration sneered. The female aberration cackled with glee. Ozymandius moved towards the aberrations, but Kleeta handed him the youngling.    ""Today? You die."" Kleeta grabbed the male aberration and sank her teeth into his throat, she drank him to the point of dehydration. Once he was completely exsanguinated? She ate the majority of his throat. When she finished? She grabbed the female aberration and repeated her actions. Once the aberrations were gone? Kleeta went to Ozymandius and took the youngling.   Venerate and Ozymandius just looked on.   ""Kleeta? Are you alright?"" Ozymandius was becoming concerned.    ""I'm fine, Ozymandius. I just can't take the way they disrespected you when they knew it's against Atramentarian Law. I didn't even care if they liked you, but they damn sure were going to respect you or die!"" Kleeta felt completely justified in her actions.   ""What now, My Lord?"" Venerate asked Ozymandius.    ""It's time to acclimate and integrate ourselves with the local denizens. Hopefully? We'll even acclimate and integrate with the local gentry."" Ozymandius replied.   Venerate, Kleeta and Ozymandius walked towards the little town of Eerie, Indiana. The residents were unaware of what was about to happen. It wouldn't matter if they did know. After all? Resistance is futile.

Maisie's Kisses,14828yd,115,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/14828yd/maisies_kisses/,1000andonenites,"Maisie realised her kisses kill when she was about ten.   She was at the playground with her friend Henry. They ran over the see-saw together, holding hands for some reason. And then by the see-saw, Henry leaned over and kissed her fully on the lips, before letting go of her hand and jumping on the seat. Maisie stood still for a moment, confused, then ran to the other side, raised her arms, gripped the seat, pulled it down and jumped on. Henry went up, and then he fell like a stone with a very loud thud. He lay crumpled on the rubbery pink playground gravel, dead.   They said it was a random heart failure, but Maisie knew better.   After that, she avoided boys. Boys didn't like that, especially as she was a pretty little thing with soft curvy lips, and the more she avoided them, the more they tried to kiss her. There was Jerry, who cornered her in the school cloakroom, and kissed her with a loud smacking sound. She wriggled out of his grasp and dashed out, only to hear once again that loud thud - she knew before she turned around that he was dead, lying lifeless among the stinky sneakers littering the floor. And Michael, who stole a kiss on the bus, just before his stop. He remained alive long enough to reach the door, and then tumbled out, headfirst, onto the pavement below.   And poor Paul. Maisie actually liked Paul, - he was so good-looking with bright sparkly eyes and he was so kind and smart. They did homework together- they both wanted to be doctors. He helped her patiently with maths while she wrote up his essays. He would never kiss her suddenly, when she didn't want it. She hoped desperately that would make a difference, inching closer and closer to him in their study sessions, letting her hand accidentally-on-purpose brush against his, until he asked politely- ‘Maisie- I've been dying to kiss you. May I?""   She forgot about her curse in her hormonal adolescent delight, and leaned forward with her lips parted and her eyes shining. ""Oh Paul"", she breathed. As his lips pressed softly but firmly against hers, her whole body filled with joy and she could barely let him pull away. They looked deep into each other's eyes, glowing with young love.   And then- she shrieked out in despair as the light dimmed in his eyes. He slumped over, while she sobbed uncontrollably.   She never forgave herself.   She gave up her dream of becoming a doctor, and relentlessly pursued another career, specializing in dealing with unwanted husbands and lovers. A surprisingly lucrative field.      She smiled at her latest prey, Jason, sitting across the restaurant table. She didn't feel bad anymore, those emotions were long gone. She had a job to do, and he shouldn't have asked her out when he was already married, asshole. She leaned in. She was busy, and didn't want to waste too much time on this one.",scarystories,20,2023-06-12 20:43:49
A case like no other,148ikzx,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148ikzx/a_case_like_no_other/,TheRealRufusGamer,"I, m28 have been a crime scene investigator for 7 years, but no case I ever saw was just as horrific as  this. I got called down to a crime scene, drove to the location I was given, and got out of my car. I walked to the crime scene, and saw something that made my stomach turn. An unidentifiable corpse, burnt to a crisp. And a man, hanging from a tree. Once we got the man down, we saw his jaw hanging from one side, and it looked like the killer gouged one of his eyeballs out and nailed it into his forehead. I walked about 15 feet into the scene, and I was on a tree, written in red spray paint. ""Kill the mother, hang the father, take the son."" I assumed the son had been kidnapped, so we got some of the man's DNA and found his name, and sure enough, he had a son. We tried to find him for at least 5 weeks. We got a distress call from a house in the woods. I had driven down that road countless times, but never saw the house. When we got into the house, and we were instantly met with the smell of a corpse. When we got to the basement, I almost passed out. At the time I had been doing this job for 6 years, but nothing came close to this. There were corpses that appeared to be young boys, skinned, missing their genitals, and hung by barbed wire on the wall. We heard a soft tune coming from a room to the left, when we entered the room, we saw a man with a saw, cutting flesh and bone. He seemed to be middle aged. We yelled at him, and when he turned around, he had no face. Just skin. I had never believed in paranormal things before, but this changed my mind.wr shot him over and over again. Until he was dead. We searched the house and found barrels of flesh and limbs, and even the genitals. But then we found the tapes of what he did to the kids. It was horrific. He skinned them and cut their genitals off while they were conscious. Sometimes he would even bite their fingers off with sharp teeth. It clearly wasn't human. A week later, I went to where the house was. It was gone. All that was left, was a dirt area. And painted in blood, it said ""Kill the mother, hang the father, take Anthony Dominguez"" that is my name. I am currently typing this from the basement of the demon that butchered those boys. He has told me I am next. Tell my wife and son I love them. I'm signing off. For good this time. Goodbye.    Everything in this story was fake. Anthony Dominguez doesn't exist.

There's a sweet scene in it, a lady says to a baby : You is kind. You is smart. You is strong.  And then my gf said to me: do you know what local pupils say before class?   They literally say this altogether in an uniform tone before some teachers giving their classes :    **小眼睛，看老师。**  **Little eyes, looking at the teacher.**  **小嘴巴，不说话。**  **Little mouths, let no voices out.**  **小耳朵，竖起来。**  **Little ears, pick them up.**  usually it is not this crazy in school, my gf found this when taking over a class for an absent teacher   . So she was deeply scared and shocked at that moment.  Anyway, I don't think i translate this well. This thing has a strange rhythm in Chinese language, and the wording is pretty much like nursery-rhyme-style. So this is something really scary when you heard it for the first time.   Plus...

The reunion (part 2),1484075,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1484075/the_reunion_part_2/,starwarsfan1979,"The liason got up from his chair and requested that I follow him. It was a busy morning in the police department. Dozens of officers were in the middle of a shift change and either didn't realize I was walking out with a strange man in elegant clothes or simply didn't care. When we stepped out of the station doors, there was a black Rolls-Royce phantom apparently waiting on us.   ""If you would kindly join me for a ride, I'll fill you in on the situation."" the liason said as a chauffeur opened the car door, and he climbed in. I hesitated for a moment. Everything I ever learned in life told me not to get in a car with stranger's, however I wasn't crazy about going back to that interrogation room. Besides, I don't think that nugget of wisdom covers stranger's with luxury vehicles. I climbed in, and the inside was even nicer.   It smelled very pleasant, like a mix of a new car and some romantic candle. The man handed me a glass of dark liquor, I could tell by the burning smell it was whiskey, a drink I had become very familiar with in the last few months. I wasn't sure if it was for the traumatic night I had gone through or whatever shit show awaited for me wherever I was being taken to, but I drank that glass of fire without much regret. ""You have been summoned by our head investigator, Arthur Quint. I believe you two have briefly met."" He said, expecting me to connect the dots.   "" You mean whatever... whoever saved my ass last night?""   "" You didn't think it was Devine intervention, did you? Our department investigates, protects from, and on occasion destroys supernatural creatures. We try to avoid the latter, but as you saw last night, sometimes that's not possible. Also, our head investigator is a vampire, I know it's stereotypical, but they don't like werewolves very much."" I looked at him in complete disbelief, and I was sure I was being punked at this point.  ""Right... so about this transfer, what if I refuse?""  ""In that case, you are free to remain as an NYPD officer for whatever time you have left.""  ""What does that mean?""  If you are not an agent of our department, we can not extend to you our benefits, such as covering up any interaction with supernatural creatures. Before I intervened, you were the only suspect of last night's multiple murders.""   I got the picture clearly, I either went along with these jokers or I be incarcerated for the rest of my life. I nodded and dossed off for a few minutes. When I came to, we had arrived at a very large, old, but well-kept mansion. We stepped inside, and the place actually looked even bigger. Artificial light illuminated the beautiful staircase and statues that adorned the main hall. There were no windows to speak of.   The liason showed me the way to the main quarters. The room I entered was the most curious thing I had seen. It was like a room lost in time. There were decorations from many different decades, and the record player playing time by pink floyd was very appropriate. I was so distracted that I hadn't even noticed the liason had not followed me into the room. While I believed I was in an empty room, somewhere in the darkness, a voice announced: ""Officer, I've been expecting you.""   My heart skipped a beat, I was even more disturbed to see that the owner of the voice was crawling on all fours on the ceiling of the room. ""Why are you frightened? I am confident Xavier explained the status of my nature."" He released himself from the ceiling and landed perfectly unharmed on the floor with the grace of a cat. ""He did, I just thought he was full of shit.""  ""If I meant you any harm, I would've let the mutts have you."" he said in a dismissive tone.   The man before me was large, wearing dark clothes and dark hair to match. His eyes reflected a sadness and anger reserved for men double his age, for he still had youth upon his face. He walked over to a table that had a cup and an unlabeled bottle filled with red. I didn't need to use much imagination to guess that it wasn't wine he was drinking. ""I would offer you a cup, but I do not think you would enjoy this particular vintage."" He said, his voice reminding me of Keith David.   ""What the hell happened last night?""  ""Something unusual. Werewolves are not social creatures and are extremely territorial. They would actually fight to the death if more than one was in the vicinity. Having three work together is not in their nature and would suggest an outside factor is forcing them to.""   ""What does that mean?""   ""I do not know yet but in my experience,  only something much more sinister than a warewolf can make them go against their own nature and if such a thing is the case, I must continue my investigation.""   ""What do you want with me then?""   ""Even if it was by sheer dumb luck, you've managed to survive a very precarious situation many of our agents would not dare imagine. You may be of some further use to this department.""  The next few years were grueling. They shipped me out to a training facility to learn everything there was to know about the supernatural. It wasn't just countless hours of classroom instruction. The physical training was unlike anything I've gone through before. I mastered martial arts and became proficient in almost every weapon under the sun, man made or not. Then, I was taught how to hunt every creature that could hunt me.   Our graduation was a final test that consisted of surviving 3 nights of back to back waves of creatures straight out of your worst nightmares. I almost died countless times, but in the end, I became a skilled member of the supernatural investigations department. After many cases around the world, my latest assignment would bring me back to New York City.  Arthur Quint wanted to personally fill me in on the details of the case. I once again found myself in that room lost in time, but I was no longer scared or confused.   ""You know, you could have sent me an email, I didn't have to come all the way to New York City."" I said with an annoyed tone while I had a glass of Whiskey by the fireplace. ""I have been alive for centuries but I've never taken the time to learn how to send a fucking email."" He poured himself a cup of blood wine and walked over with a folder in his free hand. ""I believe you will be most anxious to begin this case.""   He threw the folder on the table top in front of me and a picture slid out. It was of a man I knew too well. ""This has to be some kind of mistake, this is DeLeon."" I grabbed the folder and started reading the case details. ""I saw him get mauled by werewolves, he should not be alive.""   ""His body was not found at the crime scene that night,I had my suspicions but this confirmed it.""   ""The address this photo was taken at is only a few blocks from his house.""  ""We need him alive for questioning, there's something going on in the city. Too many attacks, too many creatures stirring up the pot. Your old partner may be privy to some useful information."" I left immediately. I took a squad of agents I had gone through some shit in the past and knew they would make good backup. We got to DeLeon's apartment by nightfall, I left a security detail guarding the building entrance while I contacted DeLeon's wife,not really knowing what to expect.   I knocked on the door to apartment 237 and the door cracked open slightly. ""Hello Maria."" I said regrettably. ""What the fuck are you doing here you son of a bitch?"" She didn't mince word's, in the year's between her husband's supposed death she had blamed me for it.   Maybe I hadn't done it in her mind, but I sure as hell failed in having his back. The animosity was a possible confirmation DeLeon had not tried to contact her yet. ""Maria, we might not have a lot of time, I need you to let me in."" She took a few seconds, enough to make me wait on the inevitable fuck you she would likely throw my way. Interestingly enough, she closed the door and unlocked it for me.  I entered the humble and honestly run down apartment without much resistance from her. ""You need to get Joshua and come with me, you're in danger."" I told her while scanning the room, waiting for DeLeon to come out of a room and interrupt our conversation. ""What's going on Morales?""  ""Something is coming for you and we need to get you as far away from here as possible."" The plan had been to regrettably use Maria as bait to lure DeLeon to a secure location and capture him. That plan went out the window when I received a notification to my ear piece from one of my agent's. ""Contact! It's moving towards the staircase!"" We could hear the gun fire from the living room of Maria's apartment.  I knew DeLeon would make tear his way through everyone in his way, no matter how well trained they were. ""Get your boy now! We need to leave!"" She rushed into a room while I looked through the peephole on the door. A few moments after the gunshots had stopped downstairs I saw a bloodied animal crawling on the wall on all fours,crawling towards apartment 237. Mary came out of the room with a small child in her arms.   ""Take the fire escape and run."" I said while I moved away from the door. ""What are you going to do? What's out there?"" She said in a panicked voice, and I wish I had a better answer for her. ""Worst case scenario? I buy you some time.""   I pulled my handgun out loaded with special silver bullets, and a syringe filled with rare ingredients that would interrupt a warewolf transformation. The downside to this is that I would obviously have to get close enough to a 8 foot,seriously pissed off lycanthrope for me to inject it. Unfortunately for me, I would have an opportunity to get up and close with DeLeon as he violently smashed the door to get in. Maria went down the fire escape and made it to the ground just in time as DeLeon smashed through the apartment door. He stood at the entrance of the apartment, having to hunch to be able to get through, I could see the chunks of flesh hanging from his fangs and the fresh red staining his black fur.   ""DeLeon if you're in there don't make me fucking do this."" I pleaded to an old friend,not knowing if he would recognize me or if he would even care. The monster in front of me imitated a smile, showing its collection of razor Sharp teeth as it lunged at me on all fours. I shot off a few rounds, managing to hit him multiple times. That unfortunately wasn't enough to stop its momentum, it crashed into me and we went through the window Maria had gone out just minutes prior.   We had stopped at the edge of the fires cape and DeLeon wasted no time in trying to bite my face off. The only reason he didn't succeed is because I used his weight against him,leaning over the railing and both of us fell from the second story of that apartment complex. Somehow I managed not to break my neck on the way down. I counted myself lucky for the next minute as I slowly got up to my feet but realized DeLeon had done the same. I was a dead man and I knew it.   I could barely stand up let alone attempt to stab that mother fucker with the syringe I somehow managed to hold on to. DeLeon slowly made his way to me, the fall had not really hurt him and he was just toying with me at this point. He picked up speed until he was on all fours with a collision course with me. I summoned all my remaining strength and prepared to stab the syringe into him... completely missing.   DeLeon had been intercepted in mid lunge for my throat by Arthur Quint. He had DeLeon by the throat and he was pinned to a wall  of the alley we found ourselves in. I quickly swung my hand to stab DeLeon in the chest. It took only moments for him to violently and painfully reverting back to his human form. ""Are you unharmed?"" Arthur asked as he backed away from DeLeon.   ""I just fell from a second floor,but yeah, I wasn't bit or mauled. I see that as a win.""   ""You two won't be."" DeLeon said while naked on the floor, freshly reshaping his bones to fit in his human frame. ""She has returned and she's a bone to pick with you Quint. In particular you."" DeLeon said while getting some sort of satisfaction from the words. ""What is he talking about Arthur?"" Quint was visibly shaken, in all my years fighting monsters, I had never seen Arthur Quint afraid. ""It's worse than I thought then. Everything adds up. I should have seen it sooner."" Quint regrettably informed me. ""It's the end of the world.""

"I'm an NYPD officer, the supernatural is real part 1",147xp57,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/147xp57/im_an_nypd_officer_the_supernatural_is_real_part_1/,starwarsfan1979,"It had always been my dream to be a law enforcement officer. Since I was a small boy, I have always loved the idea of having a gun and catching bad guys all day. Hell, what kid didn't? While everyone was having an existential crisis straight out of high school, wondering what to do with the rest of their lives, I already figured that out when I was 9 and still playing with action figures. After graduation, I applied for the new York city police academy and after 6 months of physical and academic training, I was ready to patrol the streets of New York City.   A few years into my law enforcement career, I can say without a doubt as most of us know by now: Reality is often disappointing. I had made my dream come true of becoming a police officer in a great city, but I guess I never considered I could be disappointed in that. I was severely under paid and overworked, I could barely afford a janitors closet to live in this fucking city, I couldn't keep a relationship to save my life and every time I put my uniform on it was like I was public enemy number one to every citizen.  The only thing keeping me from quitting my job and starting over was my partner, DeLeon. The only other thing that was consistent in my life Aside from the constant shit flow from this job was DeLeon.   In just a few short years, he had become like my older brother, giving me life guidance, inviting me to spend time with his wife and son, and always having my back. Last night, I was quieter than usual while on patrol, and I guess he saw the writing on the wall. ""Listen, kid, if you're unhappy with your place in life, you gotta do what makes you happy."" I looked at him with a mix of shock and sadness I could feel burning on my face. ""That's clearly not police work,"" he said like he could literally read my mind, ofcourse I was an open book to him.   Before I had a chance to explain myself, a voice came over the radio. ""Unit 13, we have 10-62 in progress at westport,"" that was code for breaking and entering. My partner had already turned on our patrol lights and speed on when he said ""Well you did want some excitement,"" while grinning like a little kid behind the wheel. ""10-10 guardian, show us in route,"" I replied over the radio while I spot checked my equipment.   It took us about 15 minutes to get to the scene. The place was some abandoned warehouse scheduled to be demolished to make way for a new mall. The site was also secluded. We hadn't seen any cars, houses, or anyone for miles. ""Who the hell would want to break in here?"" I asked my partner, not really waiting on an answer. ""Better question is who called this in?"". DeLeon had a point.   There was no one around or waiting for us when we got there. There were a few large trucks and demolition equipment just outside the warehouse, so there must've been a security guard posted somewhere. ""Keep your gun up and don't drop your guard,"" DeLeon ordered before we checked the area out. It was comically dark,the only light that illuminated our path were our flashlights and the distant full moon. It took forever, but we managed to find the main gate to the warehouse and a few feet next to it, a security guard post. I moved toward the guard post to see if anyone was inside.   ""NYPD, we're responding to your call..."" I could smell it before I saw it. There was a familiar smell of iron in the air, but it wasn't until i peeked inside that I could make the connection. It was blood. The security guard was indeed inside, still sitting in his cheap chair. His face had been clawed off,barely resembling a face at all now, his lower jaw was nowhere in sight and only one brown eye remained,   it looked like it wanted to roll into the back of his skull.   His insides had been hollowed out, and his one remaining arm had half its hand bitten off. There was blood and chunks of human flesh all over the small cabin. It looked like he had been mauled by a fucking bear but I've never seen anyone be so utterly destroyed. I couldn't stand the sight for more than a couple of seconds before I had to involuntarily throw up. DeLeon was only a few steps behind me before he saw the same thing I did.   I could hear him gagging and moving away from the guard post. ""We better call this in."" I couldn't agree more. Whatever was happening here and whatever killed that security guard, I wanted nothing to do with it. We started walking back to our vehicle, and I noticed it somehow had gotten even darker since we got to the scene.   It looked like clouds had covered the moonlight from shining down. Before I could even process what was going on something had violently tackled me to the ground, at first I thought it was whatever mauled the security guard but I could see that it was a man wearing ripped clothes. There was a brief struggle on the ground were the mother fucker tried to take a bite out of me. just as fast as I was on the ground DeLeon took out his tazer gun zapped away. I got underneath him and kicked him as hard as I could in the mouth.   I took out my hand cuffs and put him under arrest. ""Do you think I just knocked out a potential witness?"" I asked jokingly trying to relieve some of the insane stress I was under. ""Whoever this fucker is he's coming with us."" We picked the guy up and walked over a few feet to where we had parked only to find another unwanted surprise.     Our tires had been slashed in the amount of time we had been gone. I would've blamed our suspect but on the vehicles bonet there were 4 gashes that covered the whole of it's length. It didn't matter how maniacal you were, you weren't going to be able to do that with your bare hands. We threw the unconscious suspect in the back of the vehicle and immediately tried to get backup on the radio. "" Guardian, 10-30, we need immediate assistance on scene, at least one dead person and suspect in custody. Our vehicle has been sabotaged and we are stranded.""   We anxiously awaited a reply but nothing came. Only static. ""What the fuck do we do now?"" I said nearly panicked. ""Try to calm down, they know our location, if we don't report back they'll send in back up"" DeLeon said scanning the surrounding area in the dead of night. ""You shouldn't have kicked me in the face"" I jumped in my seat as I turned around and realized the suspect had regained consciousness and was leaning his face against the division cage.   ""It wasn't personal, but now it is cop!"" The man was grinning so wide I could see he was actually drooling.  ""Did you kill that man out there you son of a bitch?"" I said trying to regain my composure. ""No. My friends did, but I'll make sure you get it worse.""   I was taken aback by this and felt my hand tightening against my holstered weapon. ""You got friends out here asshole?"" DeLeon cut in. ""Oh sure, and don't think I forgot about you zapping me either, you'll get yours too.""   DeLeon exited the vehicle and I immediately followed him out. ""What's our play here man?"" He opened the back of our patrol vehicle and pulled out a pair of shotguns from a duffel bag. ""We aren't gonna let those fuckers hunt us. Shoot whatever isn't friendly."" As he tossed me one we both stopped in our track's.   Somewhere in the distance we could hear a horrendous sound that I could only associate with some kind of roar. ""What the fuck is that?"" I gripped tightly on the shotgun and I readied myself. ""Something tells me it might be his friends."" Suddenly we heard another roar, this one sounded closer but coming from a completely different direction. ""Oh Jesus, what the hell is that?!"" I took cover behind the vehicle.   ""Whatever they are, their surrounding us."" DeLeon was aiming in the direction where the last roar came from. My heart was racing. Even with the moonlight illuminating us again,we couldn't see 10 feet in front of us. We could hear whatever was out there now. They were close enough that we could make out the sounds of something large and fast quickly running from places we couldn't see in the darkness.   Suddenly, I heard a loud, deafening gunshot coming from DeLeon's direction. I didn't know if he had gotten anything with the first shot but he kept firing, before I could join in something had smashed into him so hard and fast he flew through the air and landed several feet away from the cover of our vehicle. As soon as I saw him land, I sprinted toward him, shooting a few times in the direction I saw that black blur speed towards to. ""DeLeon, are you alright?!"" I asked while trying to get him off the ground. ""MY LEG!""   He didn't need to say much more. Even in darkness, I could see he had landed terribly, and his leg was bent in a way it wasn't meant to. I handed DeLeon my shotgun as his had been thrown somewhere in the darkness, I got him up, and we could only get a few steps in before we hear another roar of whatever was hunting us. Before any of us could react, we were violently thrown in the air again. I managed to land close to the passenger side of the vehicle, DeLeon hadn't been so lucky.   A few feet from me, what looked like a massive black warewolf dragging my partner across the ground... moments after it started ripping chunks out of him however way it could. It sliced into DeLeon's belly, and his intestines came spilling out. DeLeon was somehow still alive through all of that,trying to defend himself with one hand and trying to unholster his sidearm with the other. The warewolf bit unto his hand, taking all his digits off, then another warewolf joined in ravaging my partner. The only thing I could manage to do was jump inside the car and lock myself in as the two warewolfs finished ripping DeLeon apart.   ""I told you we were going to get yours."" I jumped as I had forgotten about the subject. Still, I'm custody. ""Shut the fuck up!"" I aimed my sidearm straight at the suspects head.   ""I may not make it out of here tonight, but I'll make sure to empty this on your face first!"" My heart dropped to my stomach as I was pointing my weapon. As soon as the man leaned out of the darkness, he was lit by the moonlight and started laughing maniacally. Maniacal laughter turned into violent convulsions. He had started to go through a transformation. He broke free of the handcuffs, and his body started to grow,somehow outgrowing his own skin to the point I could see it ripping throughout his exposed body. His face had begun to morph into something out of the sickest person's nightmares.   Something inside his face was trying to explode out, so he used his claws to rip his own human face off, revealing a demonic warewolf that was still somehow grinning at me. Another warewolf had jumped on the car and was staring right at from the other side of the windshield, the other one had slowly peeked up from my passenger side window, both still stained in my partner's blood and now we're out for mine. Realizing how complete and utterly fucked I was, I started hyperventilating and in what seemed like unison all three werewolves attacked their respective sides. The first one to get through was the one by my passenger side window, it easily smashed through and immediately tried to bite my face off,it missed by a few inches, the only reason it didn't succeed in it's second attempt is because I fired a round right inside its mouth. This staggered it enough for me to uncomfortably slide over to the driver's seat.   The warewolf on the car bonet was quickly smashing through the windshield and desperately trying to bite or slash at me. The one still in custody was bitting his way through the metal cage and seemed to be the most anxious of all to get to me. I shot off a few more rounds to the one that was now apparently stuck halfway through the window space due to how massive it was. It didn't seem to hurt it at all. Maybe piss it off more. It was only a matter of time before they got to me, and having a bullet as a final meal was starting to sound like a good idea.   I turned the barrel of my weapon to my lower jaw pointed up, I could still feel the heat emanating from it and the faint smell of gunpowder still in the air. I was about to pull the trigger when one of the werewolves, the one on top of the bonet and desperately reaching for me only seconds before,was thrown off violently off the car. Seconds after it was the one stuck in the window, it was pulled so hard back that chunks of flesh remained on the broken glass left. Lastly, the door to the back seats was ripped off, and something pulled the suspect that had turned into a hound from hell out. I was convinced I was going to be next, but nothing happened for the next few minutes.   I heard the roars of those creatures somewhere in the dark,different now,sounding less powerful and frightening and more hurt and frightened. I want to say I was brave during the whole encounter but the truth is I was a nervous wreck, I spent the next eternity with my gun pointed at the darkness in front of me waiting for something worse than those werewolves to take me, I wouldn't have been able to shoot anything even if I tried with how much my hands were shaking. Maybe an hour passed when I saw the red and blue lights approach, I didn't really feel safe until fellow officers I barely recognized pulled me out of the destroyed patrol vehicle. The next few hour's were a complete blur, I remember getting medical attention at the scene, being taken into questioning for hour's trying to explain the fucked up events that had taken place that night. We have body cameras that are mandatory for all NYPD officer's to use while on duty so that should have been more than enough evidence to explain everything and clear my name.   A few hours into waiting in a precinct interrogation room, a man holding a folder and who I've never met before comes in and sits down opposite me. ""I'm terribly sorry to have made you wait so long, Mr. Morales, I had to grab a few things from the boys at csi"" the man said with an accent I couldn't quite place. ""Look if you're going to ask me what happened again, save it. You've got my body cam footage. There's nothing else for me to say.""   I hung my head in defeat and expected him to berate me of the potential years of jail I could be facing. ""You mean the body camera footage that has been destroyed?"" I jumped my attention back at him. ""What the fuck are you talking about?"" He threw a folder at the middle of the table containing photographs of the crime scene. Our destroyed patrol vehicle, the dead security guard at his post, and a few random dismembered bodies, I thought I recognized one of the bodies using the same clothing as our suspect.   ""I don't understand. What's going on here?"" I was tired, confused, and angry, and I had half a mind to punch the fancy dressed bastard in the mouth at this point. "" What's going on, Officer Morales? Is that you and your deceased partner encountered not one but three lycanthrope's last night. It's a very rare occurrence to survive an encounter with one, let alone three.   All evidence of last night's events has been confiscated and suppressed. The department will issue a statement of your partners death that will not involve supernatural creatures."" I interrupted him as he was beginning another sentence.""I've had a really stressful night, and I'm sorry, I don't think I've ever seen you in our department before, not that I'd care what your fucking name is or your hopes and dreams but you just barge in here and start telling me thing's that don't make a lick of fucking sense to me."" I drop my head yet again in  indifference.   ""All I want to know right now is, am I crazy or not."" The man looked sympathetic although in a very robotic way. ""You're not crazy Mr. Morales. And as you most eloquently put it, you and I have never met. Consider me a liason between our two departments."" ""What department?"" I asked, genuinely confused. ""The one you've just been transferred to.""
