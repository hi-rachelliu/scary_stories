I found out I have a stalker through TikTok Live,149d6my,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/149d6my/i_found_out_i_have_a_stalker_through_tiktok_live/,IndigoCreepy,"One night, unable to sleep, I mindlessly scrolled through TikTok, hoping to find something that would distract me from my restlessness. Among the countless TikTok Live streams, one particular stream caught my attention. The title simply read, ""A Midnight Stroll."" Intrigued, I tapped on it, unknowingly opening the door to a world of horror. The stream depicted a man silently traversing through a desolate forest. The eerie atmosphere was suffocating, with darkness seemingly swallowing the lone figure.

To my utter shock, as the livestream continued, the man's path led him to a familiar place—my backyard. I couldn't believe my eyes. It was my house. How could this be possible? Fear gripped my heart, and I immediately dialed the emergency services, desperately hoping they could provide some answers.

The police arrived swiftly, but to my dismay, they found nothing out of the ordinary in the woods. Without any concrete evidence or immediate danger, they dismissed my claims.

I figured that this account would probably go live again, and when it does, I'll screen record and get some proof. It took some time, but eventually, the livestream resumed. Unfortunately for me this time, however, it did not reveal my house. Just hours of this man walking through the woods at night.

""Why are people even watching this?"" I thought to myself.

The livestream that night was a bust. This man didn't do anything out of the ordinary besides, you know, being a weirdo walking through the woods at night.

I anxiously waited for the livestream to return. After two days, the account finally went live again, and this time, I was prepared. I started to screen record, determined to capture the proof I so desperately needed.

The stream unfolded just as before. The mysterious man paced through the dark woods, his footsteps crunching unsuspecting leaves. The sound of crickets could be distinctly heard. The man emerged from the depths of the forest, his gaze fixed on my house. But this time, something was different. He started moving towards my house, step by step, drawing closer to me. The fear that had gripped me earlier escalated to sheer terror. I knew I had to take action.

My fight-or-flight response activated, and I descended the stairs from my room, making my way to the kitchen window, never taking my eyes off the livestream. I peered into the darkness, searching for any signs of the man approaching my house. But to my horror, I saw nothing.

I looked back down at my phone and then back up to the window, and back down at my phone again. The man was continuing to walk towards my house in the livestream, but I didn't see him in real time.

The realization struck me like a lightning bolt.

The livestream had a delay—it had to have a stream delay. I watched him approach my backdoor on my phone. My mind raced as I frantically looked to the left and noticed my back door was ever so slightly cracked open.",scarystories,2,2023-06-14 13:05:48
Vanity,149gzul,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/149gzul/vanity/,Dawnstar1932,"Sitting down at the black Victorian vanity my husband got me, I start to do my makeup. It is date night after all and I would love to look pretty for our anniversary. 

""Tonight is going to be wonderful,""
I think to myself while applying make-up and smiling to myself.
As I look back up something isn't right, my lipstick is a little too smudged and my eyeliner turned into the dark circles like a raccoon.

""Whatever, I'll just fix it,""
I wipe my face with a make-up remover towel and start again, looking back up. 
My eyes… were they always a piercing emerald green?

""Maybe it's just the lighting,""
I look away to grab and reapply the eyeliner, and out of the corner of my eye I don't think I see my reflection move with me. But it doesn't matter, I have to look pretty. I need  to look pretty for my anniversary tonight.

I start again and start humming a tune I heard from Spotify. Things went well, I was looking and feeling great! And I look at our alarm clock to check when he'll be home from work. Big scarlet letters told me he had thirty more minutes until he got home. When I looked back something was off about my makeup, I couldn't figure out what but I had the time to fix it.

Wrong, wrong, wrong. Everything I've tried is just wrong. Different colour eyeshadow? Wrong. Different lipstick? Wrong. I tried minimalistic, but that was wrong too. Everything so far hasn't looked pretty enough to impress him.

Accidentally stabbing my left eye with my eyeliner pencil a little too hard, while lost in thought. I look at my reflection to see how bad it is. grinning broadly with an eye so irritated it looked like it was bleeding. Then it hit me.

I stab my eye again, harder this time until I can feel the warm red liquid streaming down. The perfect shade of red to accentuate my lips. It wasn't enough though, because pain is beauty, and the ultimate beauty is…

Grinning wider now I see my reflection, smudged in makeup stained in blood. It writes 'pretty' on the mirror, in the warm scarlet liquid. Not entirely in control of my own actions I grab my metal nail file…

Raising the beauty tool to the side of my neck I know what needs to be done, as I thrust it into the side of my neck just behind my jaw, and I know I have truly become pretty.",scarystories,0,2023-06-14 15:39:32

The clue from Dregus led Smanulescu to a sinister place consumed by the shadows of the city. Curiously, he followed the trail that led him to an obscure porn film rental shop. The bleached letters of the name ""Dirty Cunts"" flickered seductively on the greasy facade of the establishmen

Smanulescu cautiously entered the store and was greeted by a stuffy atmosphere. The twilight was filled with a heavy scent of sweat and desire. The small, run-down room was equipped with shelves filled with countless DVDs of various porn films. Faded posters adorned the walls, while in the background, the monotonous moaning of a cheap hardcore porno could be heard.

Behind a worn-out counter stood a man who surpassed Smanulescu's worst expectations. Tucă Bibulescu, a medium-sized man in his forties, was the owner of this repulsive establishment. His gaunt body was clad in a faded suit adorned with stains whose origins were better left unexplored. He was half bald and the greasy hair that remained on the sides was tied into a ponytail, intensifying Bibulescu's perverse aura. His sticky skin glistened in the dim light of the store, as he regularly wiped the sweat from his forehead. Overall, his appearance testified to an erstwhile attempt to appear respectable that had ultimately given way to neglect.

Bibulescu, unaware of Smanulescu's identity, greeted him with a mocking, challenging grin. His voice was marked by a repugnant tone that made Smanulescu's blood freeze. ""Well, well, well, look at this. Another lost wanderer in search of the depths of pleasure,"" he whispered with an arrogant and sleazy manner that exceeded the boundaries of decency. ""What kind of porn are you looking for, my friend? I have everything in my little paradise of lust!""

As if Bibulescu's introduction wasn't enough, Smanulescu felt sticky chunks of feces clinging to his buttocks, constantly fueling his aggression. He forced himself to remain calm and not lose control. Stepping closer, determined and without changing his expression, he said, ""My name is Smanulescu, I'm a private detective. I'm currently investigating a case where a contact led me to this..."" Smanulescu slowly turned around, incredulously surveying the interior. ""...establishment. He mentioned that a group gathers here to worship the darkness

""A group, you say? All sorts of groups gather here all the time. Bachelor parties, porn consumption clubs... but a group that worships the darkness? That sounds ridiculous, buddy,"" said Bibulescu, a smug grin crossing his face. Doubt began to rise within Smanulescu. He felt like a schoolboy who had lost a bet and now had to engage in trivial conversation with this shady character. He struggled to push back against the self-doubt when he realized once again that chunks of feces were sticking to his buttocks. ""Listen here, you slimy piece of shit! If you don't tell me everything you know about the group right now, I will defecate in your store!"" Smanulescu shouted, his face turning red. Bibulescu remained unimpressed by Smanulescu's threats. With raised eyebrows and a mocking smile, he countered, ""Oh, how brave you are, little man. Do you seriously think you can intimidate me? I've experienced worse than you and your perverse fantasies."" Smanulescu turned pale at Bibulescu's words. How did he know about his fantasies? ""Don't think you can hide them, buddy. Ha! I can smell the shit on you from five meters away!""

The tension in the air began to crackle. Smanulescu's patience had reached its limit. He no longer wanted to fight with words but with actions. In a swift move, he launched his fist towards Bibulescu, hitting him square in the face with full force. Bibulescu stumbled backward, landing roughly on the floor, blood spewing from his nose.

In that moment, as Smanulescu demonstrated his superiority, he seized the opportunity to torment Bibulescu in a particularly vile and humiliating manner. He leaned over him, his mouth opening as the unmistakable stench of feces escaped. Bibulescu desperately tried to escape the smell, but he couldn't avoid the repugnant breath. Panic-stricken and disgusted, he struggled to free himself, but Smanulescu's grip was firm.

""Tell me everything you know now, or I'll do the same to your mother, you filthy wanker!"" Smanulescu shouted, chunks of his last meal falling from his mouth and landing on Bibulescu's face. ""Okay, okay, please, just stop!""

"My response to the viral r/AskReddit ""What is a secret that would ruin your life, if revealed?""",149gryy,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/149gryy/my_response_to_the_viral_raskreddit_what_is_a/,Geniusername,"So where do I begin? Well, let's just say this story is quite messed up. I'n having to post it on here for a number of reasons (which I cba to explain)...

It all started a couple years ago with the rise of this virus. You guys aren't familiar with this virus. It was called Dentearvirus 64. The origin of the virus remains unknown, the virus itself, remains unknown (as of today), however... When it was known, it wasn't pleasant and was theorised to be caused by a scientific experiment gone wrong. Of course, scientists are innocent in all this. 

How do I know? I'll explain that later, my friend. Right now, I want to clarify that I am far from innocent. I have confessed the bad role I played in this to someone, but they conveniently forgot everything I told them. I chose a moment in where I was hungry, to spill the big secret.

Anyways, the important thing is to cherish your memories. The more cherished they are, the brighter and more fulfilling they become. You may even realise your fulfilled memories could play a positive impact on other people's lives.

Ugh, I do this all the time. I apologise for beating around the bush. The truth is, I didn't create the virus.  Instead, it created me in a crazy kinda way. It enabled me by giving me a really strange superpower, one that is rather evil. Of course, everybody else got the annoying, life threatening symptoms, but no superpowers. I know it sounds absurd, but let me explain. 

My superpower is causing memory loss (I can't believe I'm confessing this to the public)... And additionally, sometimes even dementia. Did I invent dementia? No, don't be ridiculous. However, I am more than capable to give dementia to someone, if they catch me on a hungry day.

What do I gain from this ability? Well, the virus has made it so that I can only derive sustenance and vitality from memories. It doesn't make much sense, I admit, but please trust me. However, I do have an appetite for this peculiar diet, so you'll be safe reading this post. Well, most of you, anyways. If you want to test whether or not I've taken a piece of your mind, try recalling what this post was about later today. See if you can even remember reading it. Eight out of ten of you will pass this test. Crazy, I know.

As for the truth behind the Dentearvirus 64, it was revealed, and it is indeed incredibly disturbing. The revelation led to many tragic events, including suicides. Yes... it was that disturbing. The truth turned out to be far more complex than it seems.

But how did I erase this knowledge? Why don't you know about it? You knew before, but now you don't. Well, I collaborated with an elite group to suppress this information. They provided me with extraordinary supplements to enhance my appetite, and I consumed all the memories. They deleted the files, the YouTube videos, the podcasts, the streams featuring people succumbing to despair from their own mind (after discovering the truth)... And last but not least, the virus itself. 

Now, no one will know about the chaos unfolding behind the scenes and the crazy shit that once consumed the world. 

""But wait,"" you might say, ""you're revealing it right now!"" Yes, indeed, my dear genius. However, this is all taking place on a fictional subreddit dedicated to fabricated stories. It's the perfect cover-up! I'm just joking, guys. See? It's as simple as that. Now, if you believe me, you might appear a little crazy. But maybe you are right for believing me. Or maybe you're not. But then again, maybe you are. Or maybe you're not.",scarystories,0,2023-06-14 15:30:30
STAY INSIDE : SURVIVING THE UNSEEN APOCALYPSE,149elve,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/149elve/stay_inside_surviving_the_unseen_apocalypse/,Scared_Sorbet4483,"EMERGENCY ALERT.

Please be advised, this is not a drill. As of 12:34 EST, there has been a nationwide security breach. All citizens must stay in their homes, avoid all windows, and keep all entrances securely locked. Do not, under any circumstances, answer your door. If you hear voices of known individuals, disregard them. They are not what they seem. Stay tuned for further updates.

I stared at the notification on my phone. Nationwide security breach? Was this some kind of prank? But emergency alerts weren't exactly known for their humor. I switched on the TV just in time for the emergency broadcast to fill the screen. The same warning echoed from the speakers, the announcer's voice straining with restrained panic.

I'm not much for freaking out. You could say I have a cool head. But damn, this was eerie. I went to lock the doors, drew the blinds, and gathered some essential supplies to hunker down in my windowless home office. Just as I was setting up camp, my phone buzzed with another message.

EMERGENCY ALERT.

This is a follow-up advisory. The nationwide security breach involves unidentified entities impersonating familiar individuals. Do not interact with these entities. They have shown aggressive and potentially deadly behavior. Keep your phones charged, stay away from windows, and stay in your rooms.

Man, this was turning into some Twilight Zone episode. I couldn't help but wonder, was this happening everywhere? I shot a message to a buddy of mine in London. To my surprise, he responded almost immediately, confirming he'd received a similar warning.

Just then, I heard a soft tap on the front door. ""Hey, it's me, Jake,"" called a voice that I recognized as my neighbor's. The dude I usually borrow a beer with on weekends. But the alert's warning was clear. ""Sorry Jake,"" I said loudly enough to be heard, ""I can't open the door.""

Soon, more voices came. Voices of friends, family, ex-girlfriends I hadn't spoken to in years. Each voice was perfectly mimicked, their pleads becoming increasingly desperate. Amid the growing chaos outside, my phone buzzed again.

EMERGENCY ALERT.

Unidentified entities are not contained. Do not, under any circumstances, leave your secure location. Any attempt to use transportation or communication devices besides the emergency alert system may attract their attention. The situation is currently being handled. Stay inside. Stay safe.

Well, there goes my plan to call mom. Sitting alone in my makeshift fortress, I could only wait. The phantom voices continued for hours, then days. The occasional scream in the distance made my blood run cold. Anarchy outside my door, and all I could do was sit tight.

The days blurred into weeks. Every so often, a new alert would ping, each one grimmer than the last. The entities were everywhere, impersonating everyone. I began to feel like the last man on Earth. My only tether to reality, the relentless emergency alerts.

Finally, after weeks of this madness, a new alert chimed.

EMERGENCY ALERT.

The nationwide security breach has been contained. It is safe to leave your homes. Please report any unusual activities to your local authorities. Do not approach any individual displaying unusual behavior. We are stronger together.

As the alert ended, a profound silence filled my house. The voices were gone, replaced by an unsettling quiet. I cautiously unlocked the door and stepped outside. My neighborhood was unrecognizable, houses abandoned, some burnt down to the ground.

Relieved, yet mourning the world that was lost, I decided to head back inside. I still had a home, a fortress that kept me safe during the apocalypse. But just as I was about to close the door, I saw Jake, my neighbor, walking towards me.

""Hey, buddy! Hell of a few weeks, huh?"" he greeted me with his usual jovial tone. But something was off. His gait was too rigid, his smile too stiff. Then it struck me - the alert's warning - Do not approach any individual displaying unusual behavior.

""No kidding, Jake. Good to see you,"" I replied, keeping my voice steady. ""I just need to grab something inside. One sec.""

Without waiting for a reply, I quickly shut the door. My heart pounded in my chest. The ordeal wasn't over. Not by a long shot.

EMERGENCY ALERT.

It's not over. The threat has evolved. Stay alert. Trust no one.

After that, days turned into weeks, weeks into months. The world began to rebuild itself. Every survivor had to adjust to the new normal - a world where trust was a scarce commodity. But we learned, we adapted, and we survived.

In this new world, I remained ever vigilant. My cozy suburban house became my fortress, my sanctuary in an uncertain world. Every knock, every voice outside was met with skepticism. And every day, I found a way to keep going.

I'm still here, still surviving. Every day brings its own challenges, but hey, it's better than the alternative. My life might be filled with endless emergency alerts and nights of unease, but I am alive.

And in this brave new world, that's the best anyone can hope for.",scarystories,0,2023-06-14 14:03:09
The Doll Maker,14925ut,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/14925ut/the_doll_maker/,GrimmInDarkness,"In a little village, tucked away from the rest of the world lived a doll maker up on a hill, completely isolated from everyone else. 
  

    
The rumor goes that the doll maker can make any type of doll that you wish, but the only thing he will not do is bring a loved one back to life. Since he had once dabbled in black magic, breaking the rules that was once taught to him by his master. He had brought back to life a loved one who was no longer herself. Not wanting his own apprentice to make the same mistake, he hid away the patchwork book in the drawer of his home.
  
    

When his apprentice took over for the doll maker who was now retired. Nils warned him never to touch the book that lay tucked away in a locked drawer of his home. Since that book held dark magic. He instructed Otto to only use the guidebook to create lifeless dolls, which held likeness to someone's deceased family member.   
    


""It's nothing but bad luck."" Nils warned his apprentice, ""and it will bring nothing but tragedy,"" he added, settling down to rest.   
    

Otto heeded his warning, only making dolls within reason and never bringing a person back to life.   
    

That was until... the person he secretly loved was caught in an accident that took his life.   
   
 
Without thinking, he rushed to that small house on the hill where Nils lived. Otto opened the locked drawer, and he was told not to take out an old patchwork book.   
    

Opening it up the inside explained how to bring someone back to life. Though they would no longer be human and would become a living doll. Along with their reincarnation would be grave consequences.   
    

Pushing consequences aside, Otto got to work on bringing Kurt back to the living.   
    

Gathering some of the materials was...difficult, but with a little persuasion, he was able to acquire them.   
    

Worried about his apprentice, Nils decided to check up on him. After all, the young man did just lose the person he cared about.   
    

Opening the door to Otto’s workshop, he was not ready for what he was about to see. The scene before him was just like himself those years ago. 
    

 His apprentice gently touched Kurt’s affectionately face, the person who was supposed to be dead. Who should have stayed dead.  
    

Kurt's crimson eyes opened, and he looked around.   
    

""What have you done?!"" Nils panicked, backing up to go out the door. His blood ran cold. 

    
Emerald eyes were soon on him. ""What have I done? Oh...only bringing my friend back to me, and would you not know if you are just in time for dinner. Isn't he Kurt?"".  
 
    
Otto’s eyes were soon on the retired doll maker who was frozen in place. Why wasn't Kurt turning on Otto? When he had brought back his love in the past, she had turned on him, and he had to end her…watching her die a second time. 
    

""I think it's time to eat,""   
    

The door to Otto’s workshop closed, drowning out any screams that threatened to escape.   
    

There lives a doll maker up on a hill isolated from the rest of the village who will make any doll you asked, even bring a loved one back to life.   
    

Though there would be consequences that followed.   
    

Just hope that you have plenty of flesh…",scarystories,2,2023-06-14 04:13:22
I love you most,148tkg7,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148tkg7/i_love_you_most/,kokkaschloe,"She was the love of my life. I wish I could express to you just how much I loved her, and she knew it. She was so kind, funny, interesting, and gorgeous. I knew she loved me, just as much as I loved her. She loved Marvel movies, especially Spider-Man, cooking, and swimming. She was such a fast swimmer. When we went to the lake, I would pretend to chase after her and she would swim away, screaming and laughing. I never saw her laugh again. She became depressed after she lost her mother. A mural had popped up against her window, blocking it entirely up. I loved how she was so caring for others around her, especially her mother. Her mother was the sweetest person I ever met. An older version of the girl I once fell in love with. She was in my history class, ancient history. She loved learning about the ancient events, science too. She believed in the the science about the world starting, as well as the universe. Her favourite was physics. I wish she had loved me as much as I had loved her. When she saw me in her window she should’ve said hi, not screamed. That’s absurd. She shouldn’t have made a noise, otherwise she’d be in her room right now and not under my black roses in the backyard. “I love you most” I had said, but she didn’t have the courage to say it back.",scarystories,4,2023-06-13 20:10:49
The mcnightmare,149dze9,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/149dze9/the_mcnightmare/,Scared_Sorbet4483,"I have always been a loyal customer of McDonald's, indulging in their greasy delights without a second thought. Little did I know that my seemingly innocent visits to the golden arches would soon turn into a waking nightmare.

It started with a chance encounter. As I sat alone, enjoying my meal, I noticed a figure in the corner of my eye. A man, nondescript in appearance, sat at a nearby table, fixated on me with an unsettling intensity. Unease crept through my veins, but I brushed it off as mere paranoia.

Days turned into weeks, and with each visit to McDonald's, the man was there, lurking in the shadows. His presence was suffocating, his gaze piercing through me like a thousand needles. I tried to confront him once, but he vanished without a trace, leaving only an eerie sense of dread in his wake.

The situation escalated when I started receiving cryptic messages, both online and in handwritten notes. They detailed my daily routine, my deepest fears, and even whispered secrets I had long forgotten. The stalker knew everything about me, invading my privacy with a perverse pleasure.

Fear consumed me. Sleepless nights turned into a living hell as I became a prisoner of my own terror. McDonald's, once a haven of comfort, transformed into a haunting labyrinth where I could never escape the clutches of my tormentor.

One fateful evening, I decided to confront the man head-on. I waited for him outside the restaurant, fueled by a mix of desperation and anger. As he emerged from the shadows, a wicked smile etched across his face, I realized the true depth of my mistake.

In a flash of darkness, he lunged at me, overpowering me with an inhuman strength. The world blurred as I fought against his grip, but his grasp tightened, suffocating my very existence. And then, everything went black.

I awoke in a cold, dimly lit room, chained to a rusted metal chair. The stalker revealed his twisted obsession, reveling in my fear and pain. His voice, a chilling whisper, promised that my suffering would be eternal.

To this day, I remain trapped in that wretched place, my screams echoing through the desolate halls. The golden arches have become a symbol of terror, a reminder of the never-ending torment I endure",scarystories,1,2023-06-14 13:38:00
House On The Hill,14954og,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/14954og/house_on_the_hill/,Verrgasm,"There's an old abandoned house perched atop a stubby hill not too far from where I grew up. The greenish outer paint all flaked and its untended yard long since overgrown with weeds, it looms above the rest and looks down upon the surrounding modern homes littered around on all sides. A relic of a time gone past, many in the local community have always considered it an eyesore. A problem to be dealt with in order to pave the way for something new, something worthwhile. It's sat empty for many years, longer than I've even been alive, and remarkably enough it seemed to be left entirely untouched by vandals.

I always marveled at it as a child as we drove past. So different. Decayed, yet oddly beautiful among the meticulously upkept suburban residences which contrasted it in every direction. The house seemed to experience the world all on its own. As innovation brushed away the others of its kind, it alone remained. Stoically defiant. Refusing to give way.

At least, that's what I always thought as a young boy. It wasn't until much later that my dad would tell me a story about a dead family line and the bank's efforts to claim the property to no success. And so it sat dormant, waiting. For what, who's to say? But even as an adult I've always had a niggling feeling that old houses like that, the ones which refuse to go into that dark night of deconstruction, hold some sort of strange power. Ambiguous, but there all the same. As if somehow actively preventing their own demolition. 

I finally decided to get inside and take a look. Having recently driven home to visit my parents, I cruised down that same street and was somewhat shocked to see that even after the years I'd been away, the house still remained. Now in an even more dilapidated state, its windows were still miraculously intact, caked in dust and grime to the point of opacity, but whole just the same. The entire property seemed to lean almost, having sloped in its own rot. That same childlike curiosity overtook me as the thought crossed my mind,

'Nobody's been inside for centuries…'

Obviously that wasn't true, but that's how it felt: there's always been an ancient presence to it. Something that doesn't quite want to let go.

I lay awake in my old room that night after having dinner with my parents and going to bed. All those forgotten feelings of naive adventure came rushing back and it didn't take much internal convincing to drag myself out there, quietly in the night, to that abandoned house.

I snuck around behind it, wary of being caught trespassing by the neighboring residents, and found that the back door had been completely removed. It was gone, not anywhere to be seen in the long grass and weeds or on the slimy wooden rear patio amongst the stray boards haphazardly cast aside around my feet.

'Who would steal an old door?'

The thought made me want to run, but I clicked on the flashlight and stepped inside anyway, covering my face in a bandana in the likely case of mold. I entered into the kitchen, completely barren besides some aged-brown bowls crusted with god knows what decayed food, if it was even food at all, resting atop the counter in a scattered formation. All the furniture was gone besides a smashed antique TV set in the living room. I pulled open the door, the sound of which will haunt my nightmares, and stepped into the foyer. The front entrance was blocked by stacks of yellowed newspapers and magazines taking up half of the already cramped area. 

I mounted the stairs, and each gave a similar alarming creak as did the door. Ascending into the darkness, shining the light through the wooden banister, I saw three more doors: one down a short hallway to the right, one behind, the other was directly in front of me. Climbing the last few stairs and pushing open the nearest revealed a small bathroom, the upper corners of which were caked in thick black mold. I quickly tried to slam the door shut, frustrated to see that it refused to close again all the way in its state of disrepair. I'm not sure if it was right then that I truly began to realize just how stupid I was for being there, in a derelict old house way past midnight, or at some other point in the following minute, but the feeling inspired a deep, dread-filled nausea which made its home in my gut and refused to leave.

Backing away, spinning around and cringing at the sounds of the floorboards beneath, I opened the door now right ahead of me revealing a large bedroom, entirely bare except for a visibly soggy mattress tossed up against the far wall. An eerie moonlight showcased the roaming particles of dust and airborne dirt drifting across the space, disturbed by my presence. Now desperately wanting to leave, the fact took center stage in my mind that I really didn't belong there. My stomach began to sink and I started out through the door and towards the stairs. But there was one last room to see, and I couldn't just leave it at that.

The hallway was short, but it seemed to stretch into infinity in the beam of the flashlight. Every rickety step sent foreboding chills down my spine, instinct attempting to force me out, but I endeavored forward until I was gripping the handle, turning it, and pushing the door open. With a deafening squeak it slowly swung before hitting off the wall with a soft thud. Before I could step inside, a frantic scurrying enveloped the space, dragging swiftly across the floor in multiple directions. But it wasn't rats. It wasn't the paws or claws of cats or vermin. I heard the scraping hobble of bare human feet scatter through the darkness. Not just one set. Many. I was frozen in place, until a single raspy voice broke the silence.

""Who are you?"" 

In that moment, staring into the pitch-black ahead, I wasn't even sure if the words had come from my own dry throat or from inside. After the longest time, I heard steps begin to slowly advance towards the doorway. I found my feet and stumbled backwards, breaking into a run and fleeing out the way I came in. Thankfully, I didn't hear anyone give chase behind me.

Climbing back through my still open bedroom window, I collapsed onto the bed, exhausted. After a while I must have fallen asleep because I awoke sometime just after dawn still fully clothed. New sunlight cast its warm glow over the top of me and I felt immediately relieved in the safety of a new day, thinking the whole thing very well could have just been some wild dream.

That's when I noticed him. Hulking. Haggard. Covered in dirt and hunched over by the door.

The titanaboa,1495dfq,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1495dfq/the_titanaboa/,Names_ursi,"Deep in the heart of the dense, foreboding rainforest, where the towering trees formed an impenetrable canopy, a creature of ancient nightmares lurked. The Titanoboa, an enormous serpent that once ruled the prehistoric world, had somehow survived the eons and continued to haunt the shadows of this unexplored realm.
Whispers of its existence had spread among the indigenous tribes who lived on the fringes of the rainforest. They spoke of a serpent so colossal that it could swallow a man whole, leaving no trace behind. They warned their children never to venture too deep into the rainforest, for the Titanoboa was said to be an omen of death, a relentless predator that struck from the darkness.
One fateful evening, a group of adventurous explorers arrived on the outskirts of the rainforest. Drawn by tales of hidden treasures and forgotten mysteries, they gathered their gear and prepared to embark on an expedition that would test their courage like never before.
Guided by a seasoned local tracker named Diego, the explorers set foot into the rainforest, their hearts filled with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. As they ventured deeper, the oppressive humidity clung to their skin, and the sounds of unseen creatures echoed through the trees, creating an eerie symphony of nature's hidden terrors. Days turned into weeks as they navigated the labyrinthine trails, hacking their way through tangled undergrowth and crossing treacherous rivers teeming with unseen dangers. With each passing day, their exhaustion grew, but their determination remained unyielding.
One fateful night, as the moon cast an ethereal glow through the dense canopy, their camp came alive with whispers. The tracker, Diego, sat huddled with the explorers, recounting the legends of the Titanoboa, his voice trembling with a mixture of fear and reverence.
""It's said to be a creature of immense proportions,"" Diego whispered, his eyes darting nervously. ""An ancient predator that slithers through the underbrush, waiting patiently for its unsuspecting prey. It strikes swiftly and silently, crushing its victims with a strength that defies belief.""
The explorers exchanged uneasy glances, their hearts quickening with each word. The rainforest seemed to grow darker, the shadows deepening as if in response to the tale.

Days turned into nights, and the explorers pressed on, their curiosity overriding their fear. They stumbled upon remnants of long-lost civilizations, overgrown temples, and crumbling statues that spoke of a forgotten era. Yet, the Titanoboa remained elusive, a ghostly presence lingering just beyond their reach.
