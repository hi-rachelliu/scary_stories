0,It‚Äôs mine.,149pxkw,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/149pxkw/its_mine/,Laurenzobenzo,"As a small child in the 90s, my Batman bike was my prized possession. It was beautiful. Black and blue, with an oval, glow in the dark Bat logo attached to the front of the handlebars. My sister and I spent hours looping around our basement, hurrying past the ""scary part,"" an unfinished area filled with storage boxes and Nordictrac equipment scarcely used. Our home had been built in the 1920s. It creaked and slanted and felt ""lived in,"" by us and by others.   I was in the lead that Saturday morning. I turned the corner and entered the ""scary part."" I told myself to be cool. Be brave. Nothing was there. Until there was.  In a sea of cardboard boxes, something stood out. A face. A boy.   *""STOP! It's mine!""*  He pointed at my bike.  *""That is mine.""*  I spun out, into the wall. Moments later, my sister caught up with me.   *""Why'd you crash, sissy?""*  I grabbed her hand and ran upstairs as fast as my wobbly legs allowed.   My dad said it was an imaginary friend I hadn't met yet.   *""Introduce yourself,""* he said with a smile. *""Maybe he's like Champ.""*  Champ was my invisible German Shepherd friend.  *""I don't think he's like Champ,""* I whispered in his ear, afraid the boy might hear.  He patted me on the head and told me to go and play.  ‚Äî‚Äî  That night, I tossed and turned. I was afraid, and then I was angry.   *""It ISN'T his. It's mine! What if he takes it while I'm asleep?""*  I grabbed my color changing flashlight and crept downstairs. Darkness permeated every corner of the den. It was a different house at night.   Flashlight on, I tiptoed down the basement steps. We didn't have a light switch on the wall. Instead, a single bulb with a long string dangled just out of my reach. I was too scared to find the step ladder. I felt eyes on me as I turned the corner, the ""scary part"" illuminated only by the light of the moon in the window.   *""I had a bike.""*  The boy. I didn't see him. It sounded like he was everywhere and nowhere.   *""It was mine.""*  And there, in the retired rocking chair from my sister's nursery, he sat. Rocking gently. Back and forth. I steadied myself.  *""Listen... I don't want you to think that my bike is yours. It's mine. I got it for my birthday and I just wanted you to know.""*  The rocking stopped.  I wanted to run. My legs were stuck to the floor. He smiled.  *""Are you my friend?""*  The way he said it unsettled me, like he was daring me to say ""no.""  *""Um... If you're nice, we can be friends. Are you nice?""*  He started rocking again.  *""I can be nice. Are we friends?""*  I nodded.  *""Good,""* he said with a smile. *""Friends share.*""  And he was gone. The chill I hadn't noticed until that moment seemed to dissipate. I ran like I was being chased all the way back to my bed. Two words filled my head in the darkness:  *""Friends share.""*  I kept my flashlight on all night.   ‚Äî‚Äî  I found my Bat bike wedged behind my Mom's crafting table and a box labeled: KITCHEN CRAP (DONATE.) I knew it wasn't my doing. My sister and I parked our bikes by our blanket fort. We'd even made a ""driveway"" and labeled parking spots out of construction paper and sparkly markers.   *""Friends share.""*  Every morning for a month, I'd find my bike in random places around the basement. Once, after I'd searched everywhere, my dad found it in turned upside down, perched precariously on a stack of boxes too tall for me to reach.  *""Be more careful with your stuff, kiddo! How'd you even manage to do this?""* He laughed. I faked a smile and made up an excuse.  The boy was drawn to me like a moth to a flame. My sister believed me but she never saw him. I was glad about both.   Before long, my sister, and our friends, would ""lose"" toys at our house. Every play date, something went missing. My best friend never found his Nerf slingshot. We'd been playing with it moments before it vanished.   But my Batman bike was the boy's favorite.   ‚Äî‚Äî  I grew up. Memories faded like old photographs. Five years ago, my wife and I had a son. His birthday was in May. I surprised him with a Paw Patrol bike. He was so excited. He lived on that thing.  Until last week, when the rhythmic *""thum thump""* of his wheels rolling on and off the carpet in the hallway came to an abrupt halt. I leaned back in my office chair and craned my neck, partially revealing the dim hallway. At the end of the hall stood my son, his back to me.  *""No!""* he screamed, startling me. He stomped his little foot.  *""It's mine.""*",scarystories,6,2023-06-14 22:08:59
1,When The Tall Man Comes to Town,149qz28,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/149qz28/when_the_tall_man_comes_to_town/,2ully,"    ""Must think yer something real special, huh?""       The drunk hassled the tall man, who was sitting alone at the back of the saloon.       ""All those kill notches‚Äîwho are you fooling?"" He laughed.       Leaning in close, he whispered to him, ""I bet you never even murdered a single man.""       The tall man leaned back before replying.       ""About ten myself, actually.""       ""Ah, I see the problem! You can't count to save your life!"" He coughed, pointing at the man's rifle, which was covered in many more notches than ten.       ""Well, let's hope you're a fast learner."" The drunk said, pulling a revolver on the man.       ""You've got fifteen seconds to walk your ass out that door.""       The tall man smiled, unsheathing a knife decorated with scars and placing it on the table.       ""This one is Egypt."" He explained, resting a nail on a notch on the blade.       ""Ten seconds, motherfucker!""       ""This one is Babylon."" He pointed to another notch.       ""Seven seconds; best get moving!"" The drunk barked.       ""And this one is Rome."" He spoke, gently picking up the knife and examining it.       The drunk leapt forward, poking the revolver under the man's chin.       ""Time's up!"" He smiled, pulling the trigger.       The patrons looked on in awe as a flash burst from the barrel of the drunk's gun. A large bullet hole grew in the back of his own head, and his body slumped to the ground.       The tall man remained seated and still    ""Fuck you!"" Someone yelled, firing at the tall man but instead hitting a customer at the table beside him.       The tall man counted to himself. In less than fifteen seconds, the entire saloon erupted into blood and smoke.       Less than five minutes later, the entire town was ablaze.       When all was said and done, the man took a seat on the blood-soaked porch and withdrew his knife again.      Observing the ocean of ash and bodies, he scorched another notch into the blade with his jagged nail.",scarystories,6,2023-06-14 23:01:09

3,cannibal clan at the gas station,149l8ac,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/149l8ac/cannibal_clan_at_the_gas_station/,zapzapgigathunder,"The place was a hellhole in the middle of nowhere. A sign taunted ""Last chance for gas."" The pumps wheezed and hissed, and the store was a dungeon of darkness and grime. The only people who dared to come here were freaks and killers. They stared at us with a blood thirsty hunger that chilled us to the bone as we pulled up our truck.   Max got out of the car and went to the pump. He put his credit card in and started to fill up the tank. He looked around nervously, like he was expecting trouble. He saw a bunch of bikers who were wearing leather and metal. They had tattoos and piercings all over them. They were smoking and drinking and making noise. One of them saw Max and pointed at him. He said something to his friends, and they all laughed.  Ivy got out of the car and went to the store. She needed to go to the bathroom and get some food. She was wearing a red jacket and black pants. She looked like she didn't care about anything. She walked by the bikers and ignored them. They tried to talk to her but she snubbed them. She went into the store and saw a man who was working there. He was bald and fat. He had a scar on his face and a gold tooth in his mouth. He was chewing gum and reading a magazine. He looked up at Ivy and smiled weirdly. He said, ""Well, hello there, gorgeous. What can I do for you?""  I huddled in the truck, clutching my backpack full of books and gadgets. I wore a blue hoodie and gray pants, hoping to blend in. I was shy. I hated being there. I felt a knot in my stomach, like something bad was going to happen. I looked out the window and saw Max at the pump. He looked like he wanted to leave. I saw Ivy at the store. She looked like she could handle anything. I saw the bikers at the corner. They looked like they wanted to hurt us.  I heard a loud bang. It was a gunshot. I felt the bullet whizz past my ear. I saw Max drop the pump and run to the truck. He opened the door and got in. He said, ""We have to get out of here. Now!"" He started the engine and put it in reverse. He looked at the rearview mirror and saw a biker holding a shotgun. He had shot at Max but missed. He was reloading and aiming again. Max said, ""Hold on!"" He stepped on the gas and backed up fast. He hit the biker and knocked him down. He turned the truck around and drove away.   Ivy had heard the bang too. She saw Max running to the truck. She saw the biker with the shotgun. She saw another biker coming out of the store with a knife. He was heading towards her. She grabbed a can of soda from the shelf and threw it at him. It hit him in the face and made him stumble. She ran to the door and saw Max driving away. She yelled, ""Wait for me!"" She ran after the truck and jumped in. She slammed the door and said, ""Go, go, go!""     Max clutched his side. Blood seeped through his fingers. ""Ivy, take the wheel!"" he shouted. They switched seats in a flash. Max ripped off his shirt, revealing his muscular chest. I gasped as I saw the bullet wound. It looked deep and painful. ""Did it go through?"" I asked, trying to sound calm. ""Yeah, I think so,"" he said, gritting his teeth. He opened the glove compartment and grabbed a medkit. He quickly bandaged himself up, while I watched him. He smiled weakly and sighed. He whispered to himself, ""That was close.""     Max reached for the medkit again. He opened it and took out a bottle of painkillers. He popped the lid and poured some pills into his hand. He was about to swallow them when Ivy slapped his hand. The pills flew out of the window. ""Hey, what are you doing?"" Max asked, annoyed. ""You can't take that many. You'll overdose,"" Ivy said, sternly. ""I'm in pain, Ivy. I need something to numb it,"" Max said, groaning. ""Well, you can't have those. They're bad for you,"" Ivy said, firmly. She grabbed the medkit and threw it in the back seat. Max sighed and rolled his eyes. He reached into his pocket and took out a joint. He lit it and took a puff. He offered it to Ivy. ""Want some?"" he asked, smiling. Ivy looked at him with disbelief. ""Are you kidding me? You're smoking weed while we're being chased by cannibals?""    ""Oh please, how do you know that they were cannibals?"" he asked her.   She shrugged. ""I saw a human skull on their bike,"" she said casually. ""And it had bite marks on it.""   ""That doesn't mean anything"" he said. He took another puff and passed it to me.    I looked at him with horror. ""Are you insane? You're offering me weed while we're being chased by cannibals?"" I asked him. He shrugged. ""It's good for you. It helps you relax and forget your troubles,"" he said. I shook my head and pushed the joint away. ""No thanks. I don't need to relax or forget my troubles. I need to survive and escape from these maniacs,"" I said. He smirked and took another puff. ""Suit yourself. But don't blame me if you miss out on the best high of your life,"" he said. I rolled my eyes and looked away. ""Yeah, sure. The best high of my life,"" I muttered sarcastically.   Max laughed and said, ""Now what are the chances of that?"" He pointed ahead. There was a roadblock.",scarystories,0,2023-06-14 18:31:21
4,Aka Manto: A scar under the mask,149lhow,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/149lhow/aka_manto_a_scar_under_the_mask/,GrimmInDarkness,"Ikeda had made two friends that year Kuno and Rai.           Both of whom had gotten him to join the occult club. Since he had to join a club anyway, Ikeda did not refuse.             That afternoon the club room was comfortably cool as a breeze blew in from the open window. Kuno was busy texting on his phone, and Rai was currently engrossed in a supernatural blog site.           ""Hey guys"" said Rai looking up from what she had been reading.           ""Let me guess..."" Kuno sighed, putting his phone down ""you found something obscure to try"".           A smile spread across Rai's face ""This post I read talks about a ghost named Aka Manto"".           'Aka Manto?' Ikeda thought to himself, lowering his chair to the ground he had been leaning backwards in.           ""Rai seriously?"" Kuno groaned, clearly annoyed he rolled his eyes ""that's just an urban legend"".           ""This person says that it's true!"" she whined standing up ""as the occult club it's our job to test and see if it's true or not"".           ""Well if Rai wants to then I don't mind"" Ikeda chimed in.           ""See! Ikeda is not scared like you Kuno"" Rai teased sticking out her tongue.           ""Whatever let's just get over this with and quell your curiosity"" sighed Kuno opening the sliding door of the club room.            Rai walked past Kuno in the doorway leading them to the girl's bathroom. Since it was late in the evening there was not anyone around except for a few students who were there for club activities.            Once inside she led them to the very last stall, turning to face them. ""In the blog I read it says that Aka Manto haunts school, and public restrooms. He has a particular fondness for the last stall of the women's bathroom"" Rai explained.           ""Sounds like a creep,"" muttered Kuno, crossing his arms over his chest.           ""I wasn't finished"" Rai scolded him continuing her explanation ""when he appears he will ask you what color paper you want, and depending on what you answer determines your fate"".           ""So, what is the correct answer?"" Ikeda questioned           ""To refuse, and run away"" replied Kuno, leaning against the wall behind him.           Rai nodded adding ""If you answer red paper, you will meet a bloody end, blue paper will result in suffocation and any other paper will end in death"".           ""Maybe we shouldn't do this,"" Ikeda said with concern as he watched Rai open the door to the last stall in the bathroom she was standing in front of.            ""Don't worry Ikeda, what's the worst that can happen? Besides, Kuno and you are here with me"" Rai smiled before stepping inside and locking the stall door.           ""Let's give her privacy. He may not show up if all three of us are in here"" said Kuno, motioning his head towards the exit, making Ikeda walk ahead of him. There they both waited in the small hallway which led to the stalls.           ""Do you really think that it's just an urban legend?"" Ikeda asked softly, looking over at Kuno who shrugged. Soon after he spoke, both could hear someone speak to Rai.           Rai's heart thudded in her chest as she sat on the toilet seat waiting for something to happen.            It did not take long for a voice in a soft whimper to ask her ""What color of paper do you want?"" he asked. 'This has to be him!' Rai thought to herself, placing her hands onto her knees.           Her instincts told her to run, but wanting to believe that this was true and not just an urban legend she spoke up gripping the hem of her skirt swallowing down her fear.            ""Red"" Rai answered, looking down to see a pair of boots at the bottom of the stall door. The door itself began to rattle and got ripped open by force. There before her was Aka Manto dressed in a red cloak.           You could not see his face, but she knew it was there, hidden behind that mask he wore on his face. Rai tried backing up as far as she could, but there was no way to go.           When she tried to scream nothing would come out.            That was until Aka Manta reached up, and removed his mask revealing underneath was a large scar that went across his face from his hairline to his neck.           Along with a mouth full of sharp monstrous teeth as he closed in on her, sinking his teeth into her neck.           She gave out one last pitiful cry.           Upon hearing the rattling door and cry from Rai both Ikeda, and Kuno rounded the corner from standing in the small hallway.           The door to the last stall was open, and on the floor was a pool of dark crimson. ""This isn't funny Rai,"" Kuno said aloud, thinking that she was pranking them, and any moment would jump out to scare them as she always did.           Though upon walking closer to the door and peering inside along with Ikeda close behind him.           Both boys turned pale at the sight before them.            There slumped against the wall was Rai bleeding out from the jagged wound on her neck, and a piece of red paper left in her right hand.      Ikeda let out a scream causing Kuno to jump and fumble with his phone to call 119. There is no way the police would believe them that it was Aka Manto who killed their friend. Trying to calm himself down Ikeda could faintly hear a voice speaking to him. Asking him a question like Rai had been ""What color of paper do you want?"".",scarystories,0,2023-06-14 18:42:30
5,Vanity,149gzul,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/149gzul/vanity/,Dawnstar1932,"Sitting down at the black Victorian vanity my husband got me, I start to do my makeup. It is date night after all and I would love to look pretty for our anniversary.   ""Tonight is going to be wonderful,"" I think to myself while applying make-up and smiling to myself. As I look back up something isn't right, my lipstick is a little too smudged and my eyeliner turned into the dark circles like a raccoon.  ""Whatever, I'll just fix it,"" I wipe my face with a make-up remover towel and start again, looking back up.  My eyes... were they always a piercing emerald green?  ""Maybe it's just the lighting,"" I look away to grab and reapply the eyeliner, and out of the corner of my eye I don't think I see my reflection move with me. But it doesn't matter, I have to look pretty. I need  to look pretty for my anniversary tonight.  I start again and start humming a tune I heard from Spotify. Things went well, I was looking and feeling great! And I look at our alarm clock to check when he'll be home from work. Big scarlet letters told me he had thirty more minutes until he got home. When I looked back something was off about my makeup, I couldn't figure out what but I had the time to fix it.  Wrong, wrong, wrong. Everything I've tried is just wrong. Different colour eyeshadow? Wrong. Different lipstick? Wrong. I tried minimalistic, but that was wrong too. Everything so far hasn't looked pretty enough to impress him.  Accidentally stabbing my left eye with my eyeliner pencil a little too hard, while lost in thought. I look at my reflection to see how bad it is. grinning broadly with an eye so irritated it looked like it was bleeding. Then it hit me.  I stab my eye again, harder this time until I can feel the warm red liquid streaming down. The perfect shade of red to accentuate my lips. It wasn't enough though, because pain is beauty, and the ultimate beauty is...  Grinning wider now I see my reflection, smudged in makeup stained in blood. It writes 'pretty' on the mirror, in the warm scarlet liquid. Not entirely in control of my own actions I grab my metal nail file...  Raising the beauty tool to the side of my neck I know what needs to be done, as I thrust it into the side of my neck just behind my jaw, and I know I have truly become pretty.",scarystories,0,2023-06-14 15:39:32

Curiously, he followed the trail that led him to an obscure porn film rental shop. The bleached letters of the name ""Dirty Cunts"" flickered seductively on the greasy facade of the establishmen  Smanulescu cautiously entered the store and was greeted by a stuffy atmosphere. The twilight was filled with a heavy scent of sweat and desire. The small, run-down room was equipped with shelves filled with countless DVDs of various porn films. Faded posters adorned the walls, while in the background, the monotonous moaning of a cheap hardcore porno could be heard.  Behind a worn-out counter stood a man who surpassed Smanulescu's worst expectations. TucƒÉ Bibulescu, a medium-sized man in his forties, was the owner of this repulsive establishment. His gaunt body was clad in a faded suit adorned with stains whose origins were better left unexplored. He was half bald and the greasy hair that remained on the sides was tied into a ponytail, intensifying Bibulescu's perverse aura. His sticky skin glistened in the dim light of the store, as he regularly wiped the sweat from his forehead. Overall, his appearance testified to an erstwhile attempt to appear respectable that had ultimately given way to neglect.  Bibulescu, unaware of Smanulescu's identity, greeted him with a mocking, challenging grin. His voice was marked by a repugnant tone that made Smanulescu's blood freeze. ""Well, well, well, look at this. Another lost wanderer in search of the depths of pleasure,"" he whispered with an arrogant and sleazy manner that exceeded the boundaries of decency. ""What kind of porn are you looking for, my friend? I have everything in my little paradise of lust!""  As if Bibulescu's introduction wasn't enough, Smanulescu felt sticky chunks of feces clinging to his buttocks, constantly fueling his aggression. He forced himself to remain calm and not lose control. Stepping closer, determined and without changing his expression, he said, ""My name is Smanulescu, I'm a private detective. I'm currently investigating a case where a contact led me to this..."" Smanulescu slowly turned around, incredulously surveying the interior. ""...establishment. He mentioned that a group gathers here to worship the darkness  ""A group, you say? All sorts of groups gather here all the time. Bachelor parties, porn consumption clubs... but a group that worships the darkness? That sounds ridiculous, buddy,"" said Bibulescu, a smug grin crossing his face. Doubt began to rise within Smanulescu. He felt like a schoolboy who had lost a bet and now had to engage in trivial conversation with this shady character. He struggled to push back against the self-doubt when he realized once again that chunks of feces were sticking to his buttocks. ""Listen here, you slimy piece of shit! If you don't tell me everything you know about the group right now, I will defecate in your store!"" Smanulescu shouted, his face turning red. Bibulescu remained unimpressed by Smanulescu's threats. With raised eyebrows and a mocking smile, he countered, ""Oh, how brave you are, little man. Do you seriously think you can intimidate me? I've experienced worse than you and your perverse fantasies."" Smanulescu turned pale at Bibulescu's words. How did he know about his fantasies? ""Don't think you can hide them, buddy. Ha! I can smell the shit on you from five meters away!""  The tension in the air began to crackle. Smanulescu's patience had reached its limit. He no longer wanted to fight with words but with actions. In a swift move, he launched his fist towards Bibulescu, hitting him square in the face with full force. Bibulescu stumbled backward, landing roughly on the floor, blood spewing from his nose.  In that moment, as Smanulescu demonstrated his superiority, he seized the opportunity to torment Bibulescu in a particularly vile and humiliating manner. He leaned over him, his mouth opening as the unmistakable stench of feces escaped. Bibulescu desperately tried to escape the smell, but he couldn't avoid the repugnant breath. Panic-stricken and disgusted, he struggled to free himself, but Smanulescu's grip was firm.  ""Tell me everything you know now, or I'll do the same to your mother, you filthy wanker!"" Smanulescu shouted, chunks of his last meal falling from his mouth and landing on Bibulescu's face. ""Okay, okay, please, just stop!""  to be continued",scarystories,0,2023-06-14 15:35:21
7,When Day Breaks,148vgab,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148vgab/when_day_breaks/,Divine1nstincts,"As we arrive at the affected area, we notice the devastating effects of SCP-001. The sun's rays have transformed people into amorphous, flesh-like entities, and they continue to propagate the infection. Our primary objective is to rescue survivors and escort them to designated safe zones where they can receive appropriate containment and medical care.  We equip ourselves with specialized hazmat suits, capable of providing protection against the sunlight and the infectious effects of the anomaly. Our communication devices allow us to coordinate with our team and gather information about survivors in need of assistance.  We move cautiously through the streets, searching for survivors while being mindful of any potential threats. Our training and experience help us navigate the chaos, identify safe routes, and utilize containment protocols to neutralize any infected individuals we encounter.  Our primary concern is to offer reassurance and support to the survivors we come across. We provide them with guidance on how to avoid direct sunlight, reassure them that we are here to help, and lead them towards safety. We also provide basic medical aid and monitor their condition to ensure they don't show signs of infection.  Together, we work efficiently and effectively, ensuring the safety of as many civilians as possible. Our dedication to the MTF's mission drives us forward, even in the face of this daunting and dangerous SCP-001 outbreak.  Startled by the yelp coming from the old war bunker, we exchange a quick glance, confirming our shared concern. We immediately move towards the sound, cautiously approaching the entrance of the bunker. With our flashlights casting beams of light into the darkness, we call out, announcing our presence and offering assistance to whoever may be inside.  As we inch closer, our ears strained for any response, we hear a weak voice, pleading for help. It's coming from deep within the bunker. We exchange a nod, silently agreeing on the course of action.  With utmost caution, we descend into the bunker, keeping our guard up and flashlights sweeping the surroundings. The atmosphere inside is tense, filled with a combination of musty air and echoes of the past.  Soon, we locate the source of the distress call‚Äîa wounded survivor, trapped under debris, struggling to free themselves. Working together, we carefully clear the rubble, ensuring not to trigger any further collapses.  Once the survivor is freed, we assess their condition, offering words of comfort and reassurance. We quickly administer basic medical aid, tending to their injuries as best we can given the circumstances.  As we treat their wounds, we engage in conversation, attempting to gather information about other survivors in the area and any potential dangers we should be aware of. Their fear and confusion are understandable, and we strive to provide support, explaining our role as MTF personnel and the steps we're taking to contain the SCP-001 outbreak.  After ensuring the survivor is stable, we assist them in navigating the bunker and guide them towards the designated safe zone. Throughout the process, we maintain open communication with our team, updating them on our progress and the discovery of the survivor.  Our duty is to safeguard as many lives as possible, and with this newfound survivor under our protection, we push forward, ready to face the challenges that lie ahead.   As our team regroups, we communicate with them through our radios, sharing the information about the survivor we found and their account of others in the vicinity. The team acknowledges the update and informs us that they have also discovered a few survivors scattered across different locations.  With a sense of urgency, we decide to split up to maximize our effectiveness in locating and aiding the remaining survivors. Our shared objective is to ensure their safety and guide them to the designated safe zones.  As we carefully make our way down the streets, our attention is suddenly drawn to a disturbing sight‚Äîan instance of SCP-001, an abomination composed of melted candle wax-like substance with numerous eyes. We pause, assessing the situation, aware of the immediate danger it poses.  Taking note of your remark about the flammability of the creature due to the oils in our skin, I swiftly retrieve a road flare from my equipment. Igniting the flare, I throw it with precision at the SCP-001 instance. The flare makes contact, causing the creature to erupt in flames, its horrifying form consumed by fire.  We maintain a safe distance, observing the result of our action, ensuring that the threat has been neutralized. The flames burn brightly, reducing the SCP-001 instance to ashes. With this immediate danger dealt with, we continue our search for the remaining survivors, mindful of potential encounters with other anomalies.  As we progress through the streets, we rely on our training and expertise to identify any signs of survivors and maintain constant communication with the team. Our priority remains the well-being and protection of those affected by the SCP-001 outbreak.   After weeks of tireless search and rescue operations, spanning across Montana and Maine, we finally conclude our efforts, having successfully located and aided all the survivors in those areas. It has been a challenging and emotionally demanding task, but our determination and dedication have paid off.  Regrouping in Michigan, we take a moment to rest and gather our thoughts. The weight of our experiences and the gravity of the SCP-001 outbreak weigh heavily on us. As we discuss the progress made and the lives we were able to save, a sense of satisfaction mixed with lingering concern fills the air.  Knowing that the SCP-001 instances will eventually die on their own, we decide to head back towards Site-19, the secure facility of the SCP Foundation. It's a temporary respite, a chance to regroup, debrief, and prepare for future containment and research efforts.  During our journey back, we maintain communication with the command center at Site-19, updating them on our successful search and rescue mission and the overall situation on the ground. Our collective knowledge and experiences gathered from the field will contribute to the ongoing understanding and containment of SCP-001.  Once we arrive at Site-19, we undergo a debriefing session, sharing valuable information and insights with our superiors and fellow MTF members. We provide detailed reports on the outbreak, the behavior of the SCP-001 instances, and any anomalies we encountered along the way.  While we await the eventual demise of the SCP-001 instances, we remain vigilant and ready to respond to any unforeseen developments or emerging anomalies. Our duty as MTF personnel extends beyond the initial crisis, encompassing ongoing containment, research, and protection of the general public.

8,Song of Soliloquy,148pyeq,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148pyeq/song_of_soliloquy/,Thick_Mick_Chick,"If there was one thing Soliloquy hated? She really hated being proven wrong. She knew she couldn't be right about everything but she HATED being 100% sure she was wrong. It made her look stupid and stupid was something Soliloquy most certainly was not.   She wasn't like the other kids. Mama said that was okay. We weren't meant to be like everyone else. What makes us different also makes us special. Soliloquy believed it because there's no way Mama would lie to her.   Mama was so smart. She'd picked up on all of the little things Soliloquy did as a baby and, then, a toddler. Mama knew Soliloquy was such a ""special"" girl. Only she truly believed in Soliloquy. She'd never known her Daddy. Mama didn't care for talking about him too much. From what little Mama did say about him? It's probably better off that way.   She'd been so little when the first incident happened. Mama knew for certain then. There'd been no doubt left in Mama's mind. Mama had been busy and didn't get Soliloquy's bottle warmed up for her in a timely fashion. She was just a baby and had no way of controlling her anger. It wasn't poor Mama's fault, either. She had her hands full being a single mother. It just exploded. Mama said that it scared her so! She was grateful she hadn't been close to the microwave because the glass went everywhere. Mama knew from that day that she could never be late with Soliloquy's bottle ever again.  Now? This turdy boy thinks a tomato is a fruit?! Why would he think that?! EVERYONE knows tomatoes are vegetables!  ""Dummy! I'm trying to tell you! If you weren't so freaking poor? Maybe you could afford a cell phone and Google it, Stupid!"" Grover Dill was not a nice, cute, clean nor smart boy. All he was to Soliloquy was trouble and headaches. He'd bullied her every since kindergarten and he hadn't let up one day from then until now. He hasn't even slowed down in the 6th grade. Mama always tried to talk Soliloquy down when he tormented her so. She really hoped she made it home this time so Mama could do it, again. Soliloquy knew if she had another ""spell""? Mama would be so disappointed. Please, please, please, let her make it back home, again.  ""At least I'm not named after a Sesame Street muppet!"" Soliloquy could feel tears sting her eyes.   ""And your name means you talk to yourself!"" Grover just had to say something. He couldn't just let it go.   She was walking away. She was trying so hard. It was happening, though. She wasn't getting flushed. She was getting HOT!  ""GROVER CLAUDE DILL! DON'T SAY NOTHIN' ELSE TO ME!"" Soliloquy was burning up.  ""NOTHIN', WHITE TRASH!"" Grover was cackling and Soliloquy was coming unglued.  She kept trying to distract herself. It wasn't helping. Where would it go this time? What would it mean? She should ""put it"" somewhere. But put it where?  ""Back off! Calm down!"" Soliloquy shut her eyes and kept repeating the 2 phrases, over and over, more to herself than anyone. Something was cracking, splitting, something was breaking!  Soliloquy opened her eyes to see Grover Dill standing underneath a tree with a very heavy branch that was cracking and breaking. Of course? Being the hillbilly, redneck, The Hills Have Eyes inbred that he is? He was too busy cackling like an old mountain witch to notice.   ""I should tell him. I should. Mama would be disappointed, but I just can't take anymore of him!"" Soliloquy debated with her conscience. She knew it was wrong. You ain't suppose to be doin' wrong. Sweet little baby Jesus, she just couldn't take him, anymore. So? Soliloquy settled on, ""What Mama don't know won't hurt her.""   She looked up at the branch. It honestly could've went either way, at that point. She knew which way it would go this time.  The tree branch groaned in protest as it continued to break away from it's perch. Then? CRAAAAAAACK! In the words of John Mellencamp (one of Mama's favorites since she's from Indiana, too)? It came ""Crumblin' Down.""   It all seemed to happen in slow motion. The branch completely broke free and plummeted towards Grover's useless head. Soliloquy thought, ""It's going to be more useless in about 3 more seconds."" And? Soliloquy stifled a giggle.  Boom! Soliloquy couldn't believe what she'd seen. The branch fell on Grover just as he threw his head back to laugh harder. BAM! Smack in his face! Grover let out a guttural scream as the branch slammed his face and the rest of his body folded like an accordion as he fell to the sidewalk. He was breathing really funny and it sounded wet. Oh, no. She thought it would just knock him out! This was more than she could deal with. Mama would know how to handle this. She was so sure of it!   ""Better look around and see if anyone was watching."" Soliloquy began scanning the school, playground and sidewalk she was on. School had been over for awhile. No one was around. Don't ask? Don't tell. She ran all the way home.  Contrary to the skid mark named Grover Dill's opinion? She most certainly was not white trash. It was true that all that Mama could afford was a trailer. The trailer was clean and Soliloquy had her own room and she was happy. She didn't have a problem so why did that poster child for abortion have to say such mean and hurtful things? Did that make him deserving of a death sentence? As Soliloquy peaked the little hill right before her house? She saw Mama out in the front yard. Thank the Lord! She'll know what to do.   ""Soliloquy, Baby? That you?"" Mama looked up as she rounded the corner. Soliloquy ran to her until she almost passed out.  ""Mama! I didn't mean to, Mama!"" Soliloquy began to plead her case just as soon as she saw her.  ""Baby! What's happened?"" Mama's furrowed brow let Soliloquy know she was very concerned.   ""Mama! I swear, Mama!"" Soliloquy finally reached Mama and hugged her like she'd never let go.   ""Come inside, Baby, and tell me what happened."" Mama took Soliloquy inside and they both sat on the couch. Soliloquy was so happy to be home if not happy about her circumstance.  ""Mama! It was Grover, again!"" Soliloquy was tearing up   ""What did he do this time, Soliloquy?"" Mama asked as if she were irritated that his name even got brought up.  ""I didn't know, Mama. I really thought tomatoes were vegetables. Grover told me they are actually fruit."" Soliloquy timidly approached the subject.  ""And that was the fight?"" Mama knew there had to be more to this.  ""No, there was more. That's just what started it."" Soliloquy replied and Mama nodded her head in acknowledgement.   ""He just wouldn't stop, Mama. He just..."" Soliloquy burst into tears.  ""Soliloquy? Did you have another spell?"" Mama always got right to the point.   Welp. There it was. The time to cough it up. ""I tried not to, Mama. Please, believe me!""   ""Soliloquy? Tell me what happened and tell me what happened right now. I'm not angry, but I do need to know."" Mama was getting more upset.  ""Deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth."" Soliloquy said to herself.  ""Okay. We kept arguing and he was saying really nasty things and I was getting so mad, Mama!"" She couldn't hold back.   ""He was really hurtful and hateful and I... I....."" Soliloquy tapered off.  ""You had a spell?"" Mama already knew.  ""Yes, Mama. I did."" Soliloquy replied and stayed silent.  ""How bad was it, Baby?"" Mama resigned herself to the fate of knowing it has most certainly happened, again.   ""Bad, bad, Mama."" Soliloquy placed her head in her hands and openly sobbed.   ""Baby? Is he dead?"" Mama needed to know.  ""I don't know, Mama. I just don't know."" Soliloquy was racked with sobs.  ""Baby, this isn't your fault. I was hoping it wouldn't get this bad. I was hoping it'd would never go this far. This is something you just can't control. There's no way you can when you get older. It happened to me, too."" Mama said without realizing she'd just turned Soliloquy's world upside down.  What did she mean it happened to her, too? Wait, what?  ""Mama? What do you mean it happened to you?"" Soliloquy was certain she'd feel better once she talked to Mama but she most definitely was not feeling better.  ""Soliloquy, you've had these spells every since you were born. Well? Before you were born? I had them.""   Mama had the spells when she was younger, too?   ""I was born like you. I had spells from time to time and it was usually out of my control until I got older. I learned how to self soothe so nothing really bad happened. I thought it was all okay. I really did. Well, when I met your Daddy? I thought I'd never have another spell, again. I really did. I loved him so much. In the beginning? He was good to me, too. Then? Bethany. She just had to come along and screw it up. She was so much prettier and thinner than me and your Daddy just fell head over heels. I was crushed. I was devastated. How can I compete with skinny ass Methany? What could I do to make sure your Daddy stayed with me? Well, I thought of what women have thought of since time immemorial. I got pregnant. Your Daddy was happy at first. He really wanted you. As time went on? I got bigger and more unattractive as I got further along. Pregnancy isn't normally when a woman looks her best. Well, that just made your horn dog Daddy run to Bethany even more. I was losing him and couldn't do a thing about it. One day? A few weeks before I was due to have you? Your Daddy came to me and informed me that he's moving in with Bethany. He said he wanted nothing further to do with me and would see me in court over visitation and support. He very much wanted to be in your life, but not mine. Well, who in the hell does he think he is? I'll be damned if he's coming to see you but doesn't want me! So? As he stood at the bottom step of our front porch? Flames started licking his workboots and he screamed. I just laughed with delight the whole time he was burning up! When I had you? The ""spells"" moved onto you and left me."" Mama just smiled at Soliloquy like she just told her what the weather was like outside.   Soliloquy's head was spinning. Mama killed Daddy because he only wanted me and not her? No. NO! THAT'S NOT IT!  ""Mama, you just got mad and it got away from you, right?"" Soliloquy hoped she said yes.  ""Oh, no, Baby. The second he told me he wanted you but not me? I crisped him like bacon!"" Mama laughed. She actually laughed.   Soliloquy didn't know how to get out of this. Mama actually KILLED her Daddy. She never got to meet him. She never got to love him. She'd never known anything more than the crappy little podunk town she'd been born and raised in. She could've known more. She could've known nicer. She could've known better.  ""What's the matter, Baby? You look unhappy."" Was Mama actually serious? What's the matter? WHAT'S THE MATTER? SHE HAS GOT TO BE KIDDING!  It started happening. The flames licked onto the outside of the trailer and climbed up its walls and doors.  ""Soliloquy! What are you doing? Why are you burning up the trailer? Stop it this instant!"" Now Mama was the one angry.  ""No, Mama, I can't do that. You wanted me all to yourself. Well? Here I am. Both of us can head down to hell together."" Soliloquy looked at her with a sinister smile. It was then she just had to laugh. Sesame Street was on the T.V. behind Mama sobbing. Guess Grover got the last laugh after all.",scarystories,0,2023-06-13 17:20:35
9,The shelter,148l92y,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148l92y/the_shelter/,TheFirstDeacon,"About 3 years ago I moved from a one hell hole into another, for context though the next flat I moved into was actually in a good area and it looked better than the last two places I'd lived in lived.  For the first two months everything was calm, I could come home after work and sleep without any problem, until my neighbours dog would start barking and I mean atleast 7 hours a day this dog would be off on one.  Then it started people would come to his flat and bang like hell on his door now partly I felt the need to be a responsible neighbour and call the police in order to keep him safe I mean this was an old man.  I was wrong, about a month of crap and me calling the police ended up in this old man breaking into my place, at first I didn't really notice due to drinking a little too much but things like underwear and other stuff went missing I didn't really put two and two together until I had a sober month, that's when I put up a camera.  It wasn't until a few more months later I started to realise this camera wouldn't pick up dark 'shiny' clothing until one day after an evening shift I came home and sat in my chair in pure darkness I could hear something shuffling near the front door.  (My flat had one door the front door and only windows at the front, one big window and a small window, welcome to basement flats in the UK I guess)  As I sat and listened trying to work out if it was just my mind playing tricks I mustered up the courage and banged on the wall of the hallway so I could see who was moving around or doing whatever the dog, a white akaita ran off first then the person.  I still don't know what the hell he was doing but I have my theories.  I confronted him the next day whilst angry and sober to no avail, he tried lying and saying he wasn't home.  I let it go up until I came home one day and there was a strange smell in my flat and I noticed the window in the bottom left corner had been jarred open.  I have a few thoeries as to what he was up to but it wasn't something I was interested in, it wasn't until I put a camera clock in my room I got the evidence I needed I saw him creeping through my room and sniffing and masturbating in my room, it made me feel sick but unfortunately there was no way to identify him due to him wearing a mask.  I knew it was him, from past interactions I just knew it was him.  One night I lost my temper and threatened him with a blank firing pistol (legal in the UK)  That night is the night I ended up in prison, now as scared as I was it wasn't overly bad being locked away for 22 hours a day it gives you time to think which will either send you crazy or change you, it changed me I hope for the better.  When I was finally released they told me I had nowhere to go, nowhere to live even though my licence conditions stated I needed a stable address to go to.  For around a month I kept to myself, hidden in the shadows of the city, in the loneliest of places, no friends, no family to help, I considered suicide, attacking people I considered a lot of things until I broke and I reached out to the salvation army I was tired of being wet, cold and I knew I smelt like shit especially after the McDonald's staff kicked me out.  They told me they had no spaces and put me in contact with the shelter, a group who provides winter accommodation temporarily, I agreed desperately, they picked a group of us up around 1600 and moved us into a building after about a 45 min drive I was disorientated due to the long drive.  Everything was ok to be honest a shower, a cooker, yeah you had to clean and yeah you had to cook for yourself I had no problem with that I've lived on my own for multiple years, I had no issue with that.  It was around a month later I'd finally been offered a job with a recruitment agency I was over the moon and I just went with but the caretaker of the building began to take interest in me for some reason, at first I just shrugged it off as him just making sure everything was ok until one day he knocked on my door and offered me food.  I took it happily without thinking anything, when your homeless and someone offers you food you kinda take it without question.  It wasn't until around two weeks later I started to question everything I started having these weirdos shakes and I felt like I was going through withdrawal of some sorts but I don't drink that much and I don't do drugs.  I started researching the shakes and what I found out was that if you eat human flesh you can experience similar effects.  I decided to investigate further before pointing the finger, one night I ended up staying up because I just could sleep so I snuck downstairs to the kitchen only to peer through the door and see the cook Vasili cutting up a body I cupped my hand over my mouth to stifle my gasp and quickly moved back to my room, I moved out of there last week and the stories I've heard all lead to the same conclusion they are feeding the homeless to the homeless, this is the first time I've shared this part of my story due to being scared they may be watching.  Somebody help me.",scarystories,5,2023-06-13 13:50:15
10,The Windows to the Soul: Shiloh's Final Battle,148sc2m,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148sc2m/the_windows_to_the_soul_shilohs_final_battle/,Thick_Mick_Chick," It'd been a busy week. She'd practically begged the clock to go faster at work this afternoon, knowing full well she had the weekend off. Being a police dispatcher? You needed those ""mental health breaks"" that so many sing virtues about. It'd been a rough mental health week, for sure.  Tish recognized the number on the caller I.D. lt was Ol Shiloh. He'd been a paratrooper in Vietnam, and he came back stateside without so much of a scratch on him physically. Mentally? He saw ""gooks"" (Ol Shiloh's completely politically incorrect term for the Viet Cong as well as the eponymous Charlie) at the bottom of the basement stairs and in the shower waiting for him to enter the bathroom. As a little girl, Tish knew Ol Shiloh had a good heart but a feeble mind. His visual and auditory hallucinations made him the laughing stock of many of Eerie's child residents who pointed, snickered, and rolled their finger at the side of their temple, indicating he was crazier than a shithouse rat. Ol Shiloh sounded legitimately scared when he called, though. This was not an emotion Tish was familiar with. Nothing rattled Ol Shiloh even with his advanced case of post-traumatic stress disorder. He'd known Tish's parents, and? Oddities aside? Ol Shiloh was a good man. So? Speaking to him had never presented a challenge until today, and, Oh, what a challenge it was...  ""Eerie 911. Will this be police, fire, or medical?"" Tish had picked up on the 2nd ring. ""Ginny? Ginny Lynn? Is that you? "" The normally loquacious Shiloh queried.  ""Shiloh? Hey! Is everything okay?"" Tish inquired. Tish was the nickname given to her by her boyfriend, Craig, who Ginny never called by that name. His nickname was Gomez. They were the local Halloween decorating contest champions and adored everything scary, thus the nicknames given to each: Gomez and Morticia from Addams family fame. ""Naw, Ginny girl. Ain't okay at all."" Ol Shiloh was not himself. ""What's happening?"" Tish's mounting concern was palpable.  ""Nothing right now. It was last night."" Ol Shiloh spoke, barely above a whisper.  Remaining ever so patient, Tish replied, ""What happened last night, Shiloh? You don't sound like yourself, and it's worrying me."" ""Ginny, don't you worry your pretty lil head about me. Harry & Virginia did a fine job raising you. Guess it didn't take in your lil sister, considering she turned out to be the town doorknob. Everybody's had a turn at that girl."" Granted, Ol Shiloh was never known to mince his words, but this was strong even for him. What was even worse? He wasn't wrong. Time to get him reigned back in. ""Well, I don't think you called to talk to me about my sister's promiscuity. What's going on with you, Shiloh?"" Tish was sensing his reluctance to just ""spit it out. "" It was as if he was having 2nd thoughts about placing the call to begin with.  ""I had visitors last night."" Shiloh barely spoke above a whisper. ""Visitors?"" Tish queried. Ol Shiloh never had visitors. Hell, he'd been living all by himself every since Rose died. His saintly wife was married to him 50 years, only a month before she passed away from a fatal heart attack. To say Ol Shiloh was lost? That was an understatement. Shiloh was nothing without Rose. He met her in August of 68, right after he came back stateside from Vietnam in May of that same year. It was love at 1st sight for Ol Shiloh, but Rose needed convincing. She mistakenly thought Shiloh was ""a Mama's boy"" because he worshipped the ground Rose walked on. He was not. He was simply in love for the 1st and last time. Tish was really surprised with how well Ol Shiloh was able to pull through the 2nd roughest time in his life with the aid of Eerie's townsfolk. And? As Elton John famously quoted? When it comes to Ol Shiloh? I'm still standing. This? This was different. This was not the Shiloh she'd known for the last 53 years of her life. ""Ginny, they were kids. Well, they looked like kids, but..."" Ol Shiloh trailed off. He shut down again. ""Looked like kids? What made you think they weren't kids, Shiloh?"" Tish was nervous and ancy. This felt wrong. Something was off. ""There were 2 of them. A boy, dark hair, pale skin, and probably about 12 years old. He had a lil girl with him about 7, also dark hair & pale skin."" Shiloh was intrepid. Tish quietly listened as Gomez and some of the other deputies were laughing in the office behind her. She gave them a scornful look, and the guys piped down. ""They'd knocked at my front door about an hour after the sun went down. I didn't have the porch light on. The screen door was shut and locked, but the wooden door was open. I turned the porch light on so I could see them better. They were both looking down at their feet. The boy whispered something but I couldn't hear, so I asked him to speak up,"" Shiloh let the flood gates burst forward. ""Sir? May we use your phone? We've gotten lost and are scared. We need to call our mother. Please, let us in."" The dark-haired boy requested.  ""I've not seen you kids around here before in my life. Who's your parents?"" Shiloh knew everyone in Eerie, Indiana, but he'd never seen these odd looking kids.  ""Sir? Please, let us in. We need to call our mother. She'll be so worried."" The dark-haired boy practically recited word for word what he'd already previously said, which really riled Shiloh up. ""Boy, you deaf?"", I asked, ""Who's your folks?"" Shiloh continued to give Tish the play by play. ""Sir? Please. We are cold. We are hungry and we are scared. Please, let us in."" The dark-haired boy sounded rehearsed and mechanical.  ""NO! There's something not right here."" Ol Shiloh didn't survive a hot tour in the jungle because he didn't have good instincts. ""Sir, please, if you could just let us in."" The little dark-haired girl then chimed in. Ol Shiloh knew instinctively not to trust these 2 but found himself being drawn to them paradoxically. His hand reached for the storm door to open it even though every fiber in his being told him not to. ""What the hell are you kids cause you ain't human?!"" Ol Shiloh was more nervous now than when he was a tunnel rat. Both children looked up and to Shiloh simultaneously. What he saw scared him worse than any night he'd spent in jungle. Their eyes were black, not just the pupil. The Iris, cornea, and pupil were all black but not just any black. The deepest black, pure obsidian. The answers to all of the galaxy's most burning questions were in those pitch black bottomless depth eyes.  ""Shiloh Svengaard, let us IN!"" both children stared into Shiloh's pale milky blue eyes as he stared back into their black ones. ""NO. NO, NOW GO AWAY!"" Shiloh slammed the wooden door and locked it. He watched as the black eyed children walked to the end of his driveway and onto James Dean Boulevard. They went off into the night and Ol Shiloh didn't see them anymore. ""So, you thought they'd return?"" Tish was a tad overwhelmed. Ol Shiloh had audio and visual hallucinations but it was always fellow soldiers, the Viet Cong or the North Vietnamese Army. It sure as hell wasn't black eyed tweens.  ""Ginny girl, I don't think they'll return. I know it. They're coming for me. I know they are."" Delusions of persecution certainly isn't anything new to Tish when it came to Ol Shiloh but this was different. Shiloh was full of doubt and self defeat. Never in his life had Ol Shiloh backed down from a fight. This? This was uncharted territory. ""Want Don to swing by on patrol tonight? Craig and I are having a lil evening out so he won't be on. Don would be glad to do it, Shiloh. Really."" Comforting and reassuring Ol Shiloh was Tish's main concern at the moment.  ""Yeah, Ginny Girl. Have Don cruise by my place if he would. Maybe a patrol car will keep these evil fucking little bastards away from me and my house. Best part of those lil sons a bitches dripped down their Mama's leg when she was getting pregnant with 'em!"" Ol Shiloh always had a way with words. ""Okay. I'll tell him but remember to use the non emergency line next time, Shiloh. Can't tie 911 up with non emergent calls."" Tish gently scolded. ""Fuck that non emergency number, Ginny girl! It prompts me to press 1 for English and 2 for the ESPENOIL (pronounced ESPN OIL) and bullshit! I just call 911 and get ahold of you!"" Shiloh wasn't about to call an automated line. That just wasn't how he did things. Tish was the one that could handle his problems. She was the good sister. ""Okay, okay, Shiloh. I'll tell Don. You just take it from me. Rose wouldn't want to see you like this."" Tish was truly concerned. ""Ginny girl, my Rosie can't see anything anymore."" And with that? He hung up the phone. The guys were still hanging out in the office, albeit much quieter.  ""Sorry 'bout that. We didn't know you were on the phone. We wouldn't have been telling jokes if we knew you were on the phone."" Gomez sheepishly looked down at the table where he was seated with 2 other deputies, Don & Bubba.  ""It wouldn't have mattered. Ol Shiloh was ranting so much he didn't even hear you guys."" Tish dismissed. ""Ol Shiloh? What put a hair across his ass?"" Don asked. ""He said 2 kids came by last night about an hour after dark, wanting to be let in the house. He was uncharacteristically afraid. He said they just kept repeating to let them in so they could call their mother. He felt something was off, something wasn't right."" Tish trailed off. ""Kids? Whose kids?"" Gomez spoke up.  ""He didn't know. He even asked the kids who their parents were but they just kept asking to come in the house."" Tish replied. ""Anyway, he said when he really got scared was when both kids looked up at him and their eyes were black. Their eyes were completely black."" Tish kept relaying everything Ol Shiloh told her. Gomez, Don & Bubba looked at her as if she'd grown a 2nd head. ""I'm just telling you what he said."" Tish defended. ""When he saw those black eyes? He panicked, slammed and locked the wooden door and told them to go away. They did."" Tish finished. ""So what does Lt. Dan want us to do with a couple of kids with colored contacts pranking the local crazy Vietnam Vet?"" Don sighed. ""I offered for you to swing by his place on patrol tonight. He was pleased with that."" Tish informed. ""FFS. Fine. Bubba and I can swing by a few times tonight as long as it shuts that old crazy bastard up."" Don resigned to his fate. ""You know, Don? No one will ever accuse you of being too caring."" Tish just rolled her eyes. ""BTW? What was the joke you guys were laughing at?"" Tish suddenly remembered.  ""There was a young Indian warrior who asked the tribe's chief one day how he decided on all of the babies' names when they were born since he was given the honor of naming all of the children""... Bubba began. ""He said, ""My son, if there is an eagle flying over when a child is being born? I call that child Eagle Flying Over. If there is snow gently falling when a child is being born? I call that child Snow Gently Falling, but tell me, Two Dogs Fucking, why do you ask?"" Bubba finished to a 2nd round of uproarious laughter. ""For Christ's sake, Bubba. You ain't got a lick of sense!"" Gomez wiped a tear of laughter from his eye and proceeded to leave he and Don in charge while he and Tish left for the day.  They got into the SUV and headed towards the Blue Bayou Creole restaurant. Most quaint and quirky hometowns have that one little restaurant everyone loves. The Blue Bayou was Eerie, Indiana's version. The seafood buffet on Friday nights were always a hit. As much as Tish & Gomez were home bodies? They did enjoy an occasional night at the Blue Bayou.  Bubba and Don drank coffee and told more dirty jokes. Swinging by Ol Shiloh's place a few times tonight will help break up the monotony. Poor ol bastard didn't mean any harm. He was just messed up in the head. Kids with all black eyes? What the hell was that all about, anyway?  Ol Shiloh really wanted to believe Tish. He really did. He knew, deep down inside, if Ginny, Craig and the boys at Eerie PD couldn't help him? No one could. Well, he has his shot gun on the rack, but who would threaten to shoot children? He saw enough of that shit cleaning out villages of their denizens back in jungle. He never intended to live that kind of hell, again. Strange looking kids or not, they still at least looked like kids. He just couldn't bring himself to shoot a child.  He was nodding off in his recliner. The sun was dipping below the horizon.  Tish & Gomez sat and ate and caught up with the day's activities. ""Ol Shiloh was really that scared, huh?"" Gomez asked Tish in a low voice so others couldn't overhear. ""Yeah. Yeah, he was. It was unsettling."" Tish was clearly still bothered. ""I'll remind Don later on tonight when I check in, I promise."" Gomez reassured. ""Please, do. I've never heard fear in his voice before. It's really got me shook."" Tish slowly relaxed and let the stress melt away as she took another spoonful of gumbo. ""Consider it done."" Gomez smiled and began eating as well.  Was it a knock? He couldn't be sure. The house was dark but Shiloh knew his own home. He slowly got up from the recliner and proceeded to the door. Could it be? He hoped not. Even as much as he knew those little demons were going to return? He had really hoped he'd be wrong. One quick look through the glass of the wooden door proved he was not. There they were: same dark-haired pale boy and girl but there was something different this time. There was a 3rd party out there but the darkness prevented him from making out who it was. This 3rd party was taller and bigger, clearly an adult but that was the only clear thing.  ""Please, Shiloh, let us in. We're cold. We're hungry. Our mother is worried."" Both children said in unison. The 3rd party waited in the wings.  ""I don't know you little mother fuckers so how did you know my name?"" Shiloh raged. He was still scared but more angry now.   ""Rosie told us."" Both children simultaneously chirped happily.  Wait, what? Rosie? Rosie as in my Rosie? The Rosie I cruelly lost just 4 January's ago? ""ROSIE? What the hell you mean Rosie?"" Ol Shiloh thought that he'd lost what little mind he had left. Just then? Something happened that flipped Ol Shiloh's world upside down.   ""Shiloh Shenandoah? Is that you, my love?"" Rosie. It was Rosie. Bigger than shit, it was his beloved wife of over 50 years. How, though? It couldn't be. He saw her on the slab in the morgue when he had to identify her. It couldn't be. She was 4 years in the ground! Yet, there she stood behind the black eyed children looking at him with the same set of obsidian black eyes.  ""Rosie? That can't be you. You died a month after our 50th wedding anniversary! You've been gone 4 years!"" Ol Shiloh's mind was reeling and he didn't know what to do.   ""Don't you love me, anymore, my dear? I thought you'd be so happy to see me."" Rosie smiled a smile that would have otherwise been beautiful if it weren't sitting below 2 pitch black eyes.   ""Don't ask silly questions, Rosie. You're the only one for me. You always have been. You always will be."" Shiloh was opening the screen door. The dark-haired pale children grabbed the storm door from the other side and pulled, Rosie with her sinister grin and black eyes moved forward.   ""Let us in, Shiloh."" The children and Rosie crossed the threshold and, immediately afterwards? Shiloh let out a scream coming from the death throws. As painful as it was? At least the ripping out of his throat by the children's mouths was, mercifully, quick.  ""Bubba! You are one redneck, peckerwood cracker!"" Don rolled his eyes as he drove along at a steady pace patrolling. ""You know I'm right! You just don't want to admit it!"" Bubba was getting equally irritated with Don in his response. Don's wife, Allison, was, indeed, Tish's little sister. She was also ""the town doorknob"" as Old Shiloh not so eloquently called her. She was well known to everyone as Eerie's town slut even though she married Don 10 years ago. Guess it's true what the song says, you can't turn a ho into a housewife.  ""Dude, I know you love her but she's always gonna be the town whore, Man"" Bubba tried backpedaling at least some.  ""Will you shut up? Will you just shut the fuck up? I'm tired of hearing this shit!"" Don lost it and blew up on Bubba. Bubba, in turn, shut down and stopped speaking.  They rolled onto James Dean Boulevard and proceeded to Ol Shiloh's place. It was dark, lonely and isolated. Shiloh was never one for neighbors, but something seemed even more off. Something just didn't seem right. Isn't that what Tish described earlier when Shiloh spoke to her on the phone? She said she heard fear. They'd never known Ol Shiloh to be fearful. Today? All of that changed.  Don & Bubba slowly crept up Shiloh's long driveway. Don tried rolling the spotlight on the cruiser up onto Shiloh's front porch. It was still a weak beam of light but was getting brighter. ""What the fuck?"" Don hit the brakes. ""What is it?"" Bubba looked at Don like he was absolutely crazy. ""The door is open. Actually? Both of them are."" Don shone the spotlight onto the open screen and wooden doors. They could tell both doors were open but could see nothing else due to the darkness.   ""I don't like this, Bubba."" Don was intrepid and softly pressed on the accelerator.   ""Don, should we call Tish & Gomez? I mean, I know it's their night out but..."" Bubba trailed off.  They sat in the driveway next to Ol Shiloh's porch. Other than both front doors being open? They couldn't see a thing.   Don and Bubba slowly approached the porch, guns drawn. It was dark but something was lying just inside the open front doors. As they advanced? It was boots. Jump boots that had a high polish shine. Those boots were connected to legs. Shiloh's legs.  ""Jesus Christ, call for a bus!"" Don yelled for Bubba to radio in for an ambulance.  Shiloh laid at the entrance to his home, flat on his back, staring with dead cold wide open eyes straight to and through the ceiling. A look of abject horror plastered all over his face. His throat was ripped out almost to his spinal cord.  ""Oh, God, I'm gonna puke!"" Bubba ran back outside where the evening's coffee went all over the sidewalk.  ""Call the coroner, too. This is gonna be a God damn circus!"" Don didn't attempt to get a pulse considering Shiloh's carotid arteries and jugular veins had been viciously ripped out.   Bubba wiped his mouth and started calling all of the necessary people. Don stood next to Shiloh with his hands holding his head in disbelief.  ""Our 1st kill was a success."" The dark-haired pale boy said to the creature that looked like Rosie.   ""It was this time. We must improve. We must refine. If we don't evolve? We wither and die. What would the point be to just stop at the 1st kill? The colony could never advance if we never pursued other avenues to further our agenda."" The creature that looked like Rosie opined.  The dark-haired pale boy and girl nodded in sync with everything the creature that looked like Rosie said. Is this how their occupation of Terra was really going to commence? Given everything the Alliance taught them? They thought the humans would be more violent and aggressive. Perhaps? The distant study of the  Terrestrials proved incorrect in practice in comparison to theory. Perhaps the Terrestrials will gladly cease resistance when they realize just how futile it will be.

11,The bully of our school bullied the newbie. He was not human...,148c3cd,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148c3cd/the_bully_of_our_school_bullied_the_newbie_he_was/,scare_in_a_box,"Some time ago, a new boy arrived at the school. As was the custom with all newcomers, the school bully approached him. He was a skinny boy, with brown-rimmed glasses, somewhat disheveled hair, and loose clothing: the perfect target. Not only for Thomas, the biggest bully in school, but also for everyone else.      Thomas stood in front of him, arms folded and a crooked smile on his face. The new boy stared at him for a long moment, saying nothing, until Thomas took his arm in one of his huge hands.      ""I'll explain how things work around here, new,"" he said. ""You give me part of your money, I protect you.""      The new boy didn't say anything, just stared at him. By that time, we were all watching the situation closely. Many smiled, complicit; others were scared; some rolled their eyes, knowing how it would all end: no matter how much the new guy refused at first, he would end up giving the bully money.      However, to everyone's surprise, the new boy disappeared. Thomas's fingers, which had been holding the boy's skinny arm, were left holding the very air. The bully looked everywhere, not understanding what was happening.      ""What‚Äî?!"" he started to scream, but was interrupted by a loud crack.      Immediately afterwards, and to the astonishment of the entire school, a metallic contraption appeared around Thomas. It looked like a cage, only one side was not made of bars, but a smooth metal plate. Thomas had been hooked to the metal at the wrists and ankles, through metal handcuffs that protruded from the bars opposite the plate. From one of the corners of the apparatus stick out a gigantic drill, which was pointed directly at Thomas's chest.      The bully tried to get free, without any success. Many of us, including me, came to take a closer look at the device. One of the girls screamed, discovering that the new boy's face was etched into the metal plate: his face was very clear, sticking out of the metal, his eyes closed.      A new crack startled us all, causing us to walk away. The drill turned on and began to slowly approach Thomas. The sharp point aiming straight into the middle of his chest... into his heart.      Thomas began to yell and move more, desperate to get away. Many started laughing, others just stared, a couple ran outside to call the teachers. I, for my part, began to walk around the device to see how it was set up and if there was any way to turn off the drill. Thomas was a bully, I myself had been bullied by him for years, but that didn't mean I wanted him to get hurt. Or dead... because if that drill reached his chest, it would kill him, that was for sure.      A couple of teachers showed up within a few minutes. Some of the boys began to yell, joining in on Thomas's yelling.      ""Professor,"" I said, moving closer to one of them, ""I think if we unscrew those things, we can get him out."" I pointed out some gigantic screws, metallic like the rest of the structure, that protruded from it and seemed to keep it assembled.      The professor looked at me, then looked at the structure and nodded. ""I'll get some screwdrivers,"" he said, and ran off.      As we waited, we all watched in horror as the drill moved closer and closer to Thomas's body. The bully was still squirming, and he had started sobbing like a baby. Many guys laughed at this. Most of us, however, were now more concerned than amused.      The new boy's face was still there, in the metallic silver, impassive and with his eyes closed, as if he were a punishing god.      The drill was already halfway through when the professor arrived with the screwdrivers. I took one. Several more took others. All together we began to try to remove the screws.      They were so big and so locked that it took incredible force to move them even an inch. The vibration of the drill and Thomas's crying and struggling were not helping the overall situation.      ""Thomas,"" the professor said at one point, ""we need you to calm down. We'll get you out of there, don't worry. But please don't move.""      The bully nodded. Tears streamed down his face and he kept his eyes closed, so he wouldn't look at the drill.      The screw that I was removing was halfway. The drill was several inches from Thomas's body and for a moment I panicked. What would happen if we didn't get it out in time? What explanation would we give? It would be a disaster, that's for sure. Not just for Thomas's family and the school, but for everyone. I couldn't even imagine what it must be like to watch someone get pierced by a screw spinning at full speed. The entire hallway would be drenched in blood and... other things I didn't even want to think about.      I shook my head, trying to push those thoughts away, and turned my attention back to the screw. I twisted and pulled with all the strength I had, causing the screw to come out a little more. At that moment, one of the teachers managed to remove one of the screws, which fell to the floor with a metallic noise that startled us all. The other teacher was already close to removing another. I was in the middle, and the other boys were in situations similar to mine.      But Thomas didn't have that much time. The drill was dangerously close to his body, to his chest. When the second screw fell, both teachers began to help with the others.      Thomas's eyes narrowed, and seeing how close he was to death, he gave a desperate squeal and began to move in all directions.      ""Thomas, calm down!"" yelled one of the teachers.      The third and fourth screws fell to the ground. There were only two left. One of them, mine. The teachers went to help, as well as the other boys. The bully's scream filled the hallway, the drill was very close.      The fifth screw fell.      Thomas was still yelling. The drill seemed to be already touching the leather jacket he was wearing.      The professor and I gave the last pull; the sixth and final screw fell to the floor.      The metal holding Thomas in place split open and he fell to his knees, shivering. He covered his face with his hands and began to cry again.      The teachers went to help him. Almost automatically, I looked at the drill: it had stopped.      The teachers helped the bully to his feet and took him away, trying to calm him down. The rest of us stayed and watched the device, which began to vanish into thin air, as mysteriously as it had appeared.      No one ever saw the new guy again. Nobody even remembers his name, if he ever said it. The teachers don't know who he was...apparently there was no transfer scheduled for that day.      Thomas is no longer a bully.",scarystories,1,2023-06-13 06:24:42
12,Do Not Follow It Home,148go4u,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148go4u/do_not_follow_it_home/,LilHeartFailure,"So I live in a relatively new house in the neighborhood. It's a few minutes off the interstate and the last house on the end of a long, winding road in my neighborhood. I got the house about a month ago now. It was awfully cheap for such a relatively nice neighborhood and such a new house. Every night going home from my work across the city has been an amazing drive. The interstate is empty, the houses all the way up to mine have gone to bed, and the roads are silent. The only bad thing is how empty it can feel. The lights in my half of the neighborhood have been off for a little under a week now and it's quite frightening to say the least.          Today however, something peculiar happened. I want to get these words out to someone before something happens to me. I was driving from work. It had been relatively the same drive until about 10 or so minutes until my exit from the interstate. A blue, greenish sedan entered into the interstate just in front of me. I wasn't first off scared but it was odd as it was the first car I'd ever seen on my way back home in the night. It was going about the same speed as me and I didn't care to pass it. As I saw their blinker turn to get into the same exit as me I felt off. It's like I already knew what was going to happen. And sure enough they turned a few minutes later into my same neighborhood entrance, down the same long and dark road, and into my driveway. Yes, my driveway. Let me say to you, whoever reads this, if this happens to you turn around and leave. I am truly scared of what might happen.           I parked right behind them and waited for a moment. Their car was off with no light inside. I was scared maybe I accidentally zoned out and followed this poor soul home but no, my address read clearly on the house. So again, I was this poor soul. I got out of my car and began to briskly walk into my sheltering home, only briefly glancing towards my strange visitor's car Yet, no one remained inside. As I got to my door I fumbled my keys, hearing a noise behind me, not walking, but scratching along the pavement as it drew closer and closer, rather slowly. Finally, the key was inside the lock and turned letting me sigh in relief and forcing myself into the dark house and quickly shutting it and locking it behind me.           I almost instantly forgot about the situation and began to do my normal routine. Fix a small snack, shower, and whatnot. I got into my bed and laid there, thinking back on all the madness that happened. In my sudden remembrance of fear I quickly arose and turned on my desk light across the room, taking my phone back to my bed with me. And that's when it started.           The scratching sound. Like  clawing at the door to my seemingly safe house. Then silence. My relief was instantly killed when I heard the dragging, scratching noise against my hardwood floors. I heard pictures fall and clash as it crept slowly towards my room. And that's where I am now. Quickly writing this to warn someone as it begins to scratch at my door. As it now goes silently as it did before, and as my light on the other side of my room darkens. I shiver in fear here. Please all I ask of you. DO. NOT. FOLLOW. IT.

13,It's there...,148d6yu,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148d6yu/its_there/,panterium,"My dad had bought a house straight up for cash just out on a whim, he had suprised me and my two other siblings so it was a step up from the slums for sure, he came across some money which he won't explain and I shouldnt care how so but that's not the point.   All he told us was that the house was for cheap and got a good deal for it, the only catch was that it needed some repair work, as my dad was carpenter, he could fix it up no problem at all, it was his thing.  I being the older child of the three, I had a help in it and I wasn't to bad at it myself.  It took a few months to complete the work since I was still in school so it became a weekend project for the two of us while the young ones played and did their own thing.  My brother Tim was always the goofy one and always laughing, playing practical jokes and was the laugh of the family, always wanted to be a comedian as he says.  But he started to change after the first month we moved in and did the work, his jokes became less and less and he grew mean to our youngest sister, he began to swear and have random out bursts, fits of rage that would land him in trouble with our father, of course he would be disciplined and had his toys taken away which would just make things worse.  We had no clue as to why he was acting this way, his health started to drop and even so we asked why he was being like this, there were a few times he would seem like he wanted to speak up and tells us but he would just stop mid sentence throw a fit.  One night as our father was out working late, I was with the kids and Tim started to act up, I called my father cause this anger was becoming destructive like never before.  It didn't take long for our father to get home and when he did he found tim sitting on his bed which was pushed away from the wall and seen he had been attacking one certain spot on the wall, scratches and dents along with red markings from his crayons drawn in circles could be seen.  My father managed to calm him down as he cried uncontrollablely in his arms, I stood against the door frame watching the whole thing and something told me that he was trying to tell us something.  That weekend I suggested that the youngins be sent to our aunts for the night and dad agreed.  He seemed alright at my aunt's or so she says, he was his normal self and was happy to hear that.  When I knew me and dad were alone, I went down to the shed and grabbed a sledgehammer as he watched what I was about to do, he looked at me like I was crazy as I took the first swing ""what the hell are you doing boy?!""  I looked at him and kept swinging till there was a two foot hole in the wall, I pulled out another foot of dry wall off and grabbed a flashlight.   Dad stood over my shoulder as I shined the light into the darkness and we both instantly stepped back in fear.  My dad pulled me back and he grabs a hug piece of the wall and ripped it back along with some pieces of wood and that's where it was... A mummified hand falls out with three fingers curled and the index finger pointed out.  We pulled the rest of the wall back to find the rest of the body and found it had been a female... Dad immediately called the cops and they came with a forensic team to investigate everything which took a few days, turns out that the woman had been murdered in Tim's room and her remains were sealed.  What really disturbed me was that the fact her hand, her pointing finger was right where Tim's head would be when he slept.  When we asked him about what was going on with him, he didn't hesitate to tell us ""the woman in my wall talks to me, she kept tapping on the wall when I tried to sleep but she wouldn't stop! She won't stop until I helped her but I couldn't tell anyone, she choked me.""  We never knew anything even as he tried to tell us, that was the cause of his outbursts and acting differently.   As we grew up Tim just kind of forgotten the whole thing and we never mentioned it, we moved out of the house soon after that and everything went back to normal, me and dad brought it up sometimes but that's it, we never knew how that woman was killed or who did it, we were just glad Tim is ok and we're out of that house.

14,The Windows to the Soul: The Venerate Syndicate,148sjbj,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148sjbj/the_windows_to_the_soul_the_venerate_syndicate/,Thick_Mick_Chick,"Note: This is Part 4   Part 1: Shiloh's Final Battle   Part 2: Allie's Assimilation   Part 3: Alliance of Alliances     ""NO! NO! IT CAN'T BE!,"" Ozymandius screamed.   ""Ozymandius?! What is it?"" Kleeta was concerned.   ""The youngling was born way too soon! It also killed it's Terrian mother and that fool she married!"" Ozymandius was beside himself. How? Venerate and his docile nature were sure to make the second generation Belammina the best and last resolution. They'd gone over everything in finite detail. The Vanguard, Alliance and Venerate were foolproof, or so they ascertained.    ""Ozymandius?"" Kleeta approached.   ""WHY DID THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN, AGAIN?"" Ozymandius couldn't focus on answering Kleeta. What now? Was it too late?   Kleeta took Ozymandius' face in her hands and looked into his eyes, where tears were streaming down by this point. ""We have the option of going to Terra and assessing the situation before the Vanguard & Alliance even find out that the youngling has been born to the Terrian whore."" How could Kleeta appear so kind with those demonic eyes? Ozymandius would never know.   ""Kleeta, if only we could..."" Kleeta already knew where Ozymandius was headed with this and it was pointless.   ""Don't say it, Ozymandius. It's forbidden for Atramentarians to mate with Belammina. Atramentarians don't even associate with Belammina, let alone marry them. It'd be better if..."" It was then Ozymandius grabbed and interrupted her. He pressed his lips against hers and gently glided his tongue in between. He tasted masculine, sweet and good. She returned the kiss with fervor. He was getting aroused.   ""Stop it, Ozymandius! We can't! It is forbidden and we will both suffer greatly for it! Have you forgotten how bad things were for us when you were overthrown with a coup d'√©tat? You were unbearable, Ozymandius! I can't go through that, again!"" Kleeta pushed him back. His face looked like she'd just slapped him. He was crushed.   ""Kleeta? I love you. I cannot take you as my wife, per Atramentarian law. You know this as well as I do. They've restricted Belammina from being able to mate with Atramentarians the 'natural' way. They can only combine DNA under the strictest circumstances and in a sterile laboratory. They haven't stopped me from loving you. They never could."" Ozymandius took her hand into his. The flesh was soft to touch and cold. It was so pale white? It had tinges of blue. She refused to look up at him.   ""Kleeta, come with me. I won't hurt you. I never could. The Vanguard and Alliance will never know. We're getting ready to board the Rhombus to head to Terra. It takes 2 Terra days to even reach the Stygian Quadrant. It takes another Terra day to reach their planet."" Ozymandius led Kleeta onto the Rhombus. As the name indicates? Their vessel is not only diamond shaped? It's also made of them. The Rhombus has proven itself very effective. Running on centrifugal force? It's an energy source that is renewable wherever they travel so they never become stranded. To increase visibility? The Rhombus alternately blinks blue, red and green.    ""Ozymandius, we can't..."" Kleeta sat on the sleeper, watching him program Terra's destination into the Rhombus' system. When he finished? He turned to her.   ""Kleeta, it's okay. The Vanguard and Alliance will never know. It's just you and I for 3 Terra days. I want to thank you in a way I've never been able to before. How could they ever know? They won't."" Ozymandius walked towards her and gently smiled.   ""Ozymandius? I just know that it's wrong. I also know I love you, too. I just..."" Kleeta trailed off. She couldn't bring her eyes up from the floor    ""Kleeta, my love, we are safe. They'll never know. I'm so grateful they made conception limited to the labs. There's no proof. We won't be found out."" Ozymandius stood before Kleeta, bare naked and erect, but she wouldn't look up.   He was the one that took Kleeta's face into his hands this time. Her obsidian eyes traipsed slowly over his body. His skin was also soft and pale but it was a pretty color, a much nicer shade than Kleeta's corpse-like tone of bluish-white. He was fully aroused and anticipating Kleeta's response. He'd never force Kleeta into something she didn't want. That's just not how he did things. He'd manhandled many an Atramentarian Vanguard soldier but his Kleeta? Never could he ever hurt the only being that had truly accepted, supported and loved him when no one else even tolerated him.   Kleeta stood and unzipped the body suit she'd been wearing. She slipped her shoulders and arms out and let it fall to the floor. Ozymandius began kissing Kleeta, again. This time? Kleeta gave in fully. His hands caressed her face, shoulders, breasts  and down to her pelvic region. She, too, was as aroused as Ozymandius.    ""Lay down, My Heart, and allow me to show you all that you are to me and all I will ever be,"" Ozymandius gently guided Kleeta down onto the sleeper. She wasted no time spreading her legs and he entered without hesitation. She softly sighed and pulled him closer, she locked her legs around his body and they made love on and off for the 3 day trip to Terra.   Gomez and Tish had just woken up when Gomez's city issued phone started ringing, again. Gomez and Tish exchanged concerned glances.   ""Craig Oliver, Chief of Police, Eerie, Indiana,"" Gomez answered. Tish watched on, brow furrowed.    ""Hey, Craig. It's Adam Evans, Lawrence County Coroner."" Gomez surmised it must be in relation to Ol Shiloh Svengaard.    ""Hi, Adam. Is this about Ol Shiloh?"" Gomez inquired.    ""Unfortunately? It's about that and so much more,"" Adam wasn't even sure how to proceed with the cluster fuck of information that was getting ready to pour onto Gomez, ""Yeah, I've garnered more information on his case, but that isn't the priority right now.""   If a homicide in Eerie, Indiana didn't warrant the coroner calling? WTH else is? Gomez didn't like the sound of this at all. He had his phone on speaker. Tish was furiously wringing her hands, a habit she developed as a child when she was nervous.   ""We got a phone call from Kennedy this morning. He was frantic..."" Adam's voice trailed off in Gomez's head. Wait did he say Kennedy, the Eerie, Indiana version of Channing Tatum? If Kennedy and the coroner met this morning? That meant his ass needed to get into motion.    ""There's been an incident at the Donald & Allison Hoff residence at some point and time between late last night and very early this morning..."" Before Adam could utter another word? He cut him off.   ""Don is one of my officers and his wife, Allison, is my girlfriend, Tish's, sister."" Gomez was terrified of what Adam's next words were going to be...   ""Craig, I'm so sorry. Donald and Allison Hoff were attacked and murdered in their home at some point. I'm still trying to ascertain the time..."" Gomez dropped the phone as soon as he heard Tish scream. He flew towards her to try to grab her before she hit the floor. Unfortunately, he didn't make it. He hit his knees and scooped her into his arms. Tish was racked with sobs.   It wasn't like Tish had never considered the possibility that Allie would be murdered by one of her ""conquests"". She'd feared it for the majority of her life really. They'd tried talking to her every since she was a teen. It never worked. It never got through. Of course it wouldn't with Allie! Thank God Mom and Dad were gone and wouldn't have to endure this. Tish wasn't sure how she'd get through it. It was imperative that she had Gomez's support in her time of need. He also had her support in the loss of his fellow officer and friend.   The Rhombus spun down and on top of a large hill in the middle of a Lawrence County forested area. The vessel's door opened slowly as steam rose up from underneath the Rhombus. The debarking plank dropped and Ozymandius and Kleeta descended the ship. Ozymandius had programmed the Rhombus to get to Terra. The Rhombus, as advanced as it was, found an Einstein-Rosen bridge and was able to get them to Terra in hours instead of days. It didn't matter. Ozymandius thanked Kleeta several times during their journey, regardless.    ""Ozymandius? Where are they?"" Kleeta looked all over and saw no sign of Venerate and the 2 aberrations.    ""They knew where we landed. Venerate had the coordinates. My guess? They weren't anticipating our arrival so soon."" Ozymandius did make sense considering they, themselves,  thought it would take much longer to reach Terra.    The trees to the right softly glowed a bright green. Venerate and the 2 aberrations were approaching the Rhombus' landing zone.    ""Ozymandius, they're coming."" Kleeta pointed towards the woods.   Ozymandius and Kleeta saw the 2 aberrations and Venerate ascend the hill and approach them. Ozymandius took a deep breath. Kleeta sensed his distress. ""What happened, Venerate?"" Ozymandius didn't even wait for them to get all the way to him before he asked.    ""We don't know, yet, My Lord. The youngling came forth in a manner of hours after conception. There is no way we could have planned a contingency for this."" Venerate truly looked troubled. As difficult as it was to try to predict any kind of emotion by looking at him? Ozymandius definitely could tell by the tone of voice that Venerate was as troubled as he.   ""I know both of us spent years researching and studying past mistakes to ensure we'd have a minimal risk of failure. Not only have we failed, again? We've failed worse with the second Belammina trial than we did with the 1st,"" Ozymandius rubbed his temples to the sides of his strawberry blonde hair.    Venerate began to speak but the male aberration spoke up first, ""You're a fool and a coward! You shouldn't even be here! Kleeta should rule! Not you! She's superior, but Atramentarians fear what they don't know and they hate what they fear! You should have done the decent thing! If you were truly noble? You'd have committed Hari Kari instead of trying to recover a reputation that isn't tarnished. It's purely rusted!"" As soon as he finished? Both aberrations looked at Ozymandius anticipating a violent outburst with sinister smiles.   Before Ozymandius spoke? Kleeta stormed over to the male aberration and slapped him to the ground and also slapped the female aberration simply for agreeing with him. ""HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO YOUR LORD IN THAT MANNER!!!,"" Kleeta had never, in her entire life, struck anyone or shown any form of violence, even any sign of anger. Ozymandius and Venerate were stunned.   ""NEVER, AND I MEAN, NEVER SPEAK TO YOUR LORD IN THAT MANNER, AGAIN!"" Kleeta was beside herself in anger. The 2 aberrations just stared at Kleeta with disdain.  The male aberration stood up, brushing dirt, leaves and grass off.    ""You aren't suppose to strike your own kind, Kleeta. What would the Vanguard & Alliance say if I informed them?"" The 2 aberrations smiled diabolically, yet, again.   ""How can you tell them if you never make it back to Atramentous?"" Kleeta fired right back.   The smiles the 2 aberrations wore quickly faded. Ozymandius was stunned. He had never known Kleeta to stick up for herself, but she seemed to have no problem sticking up for him. ""Thank you, Kleeta."" Ozymandius squeaked out.    ""It is a duty, a duty both of them know they should have. You are still their Lord & Master, whether they want to recognize you as such or not!"" Kleeta was seething.   ""Apologies, Milord."" The male aberration sarcastically hissed. The female aberration stifled a giggle.    ""Watch it, Parasite!"" Kleeta warned.   ""Yes, well, now that we've moved past that? We need to locate the youngling before it destroys all of our well laid plans."" Venerate attempted to be the voice of reason.    ""When did you actually see it last?"" Ozymandius questioned Venerate.    ""The youngling slithered/climbed out the front door of it's mother's house."" Venerate replied.   ""You weren't able to get it?"" Ozymandius inquired.    ""No, My Lord. We really did try."" Venerate was also upset.   ""Do we have any way to track the youngling?"" Ozymandius was really desperate. If they could at least recover the youngling? The Alliance would never have to know. If that fucking male aberration doesn't keep his mouth shut? He most certainly won't be alive to tell the Vanguard and Alliance. From Kleeta's reaction? She may not wait that long.   ""Ozone probes for closer distances but the youngling could be anywhere."" Venerate was just as perplexed as Ozymandius.    Kleeta heard a distant voice, ""Mother?"", it hissed and sounded wet.   ""What was that?"" She looked around quizzically.    Ozymandius, Venerate and the 2 aberrations returned her quizzical look. ""What was what, Kleeta?"" Ozymandius asked, in return.    ""None of you heard that?"" Kleeta was extremely perplexed.    ""We hear nothing, Kleeta."" Ozymandius and Venerate said, in unison. The aberrations just stared at Kleeta, seething.   ""MOTHER?"" The youngling crawled up the hill towards Kleeta, hissing. The 2 aberrations moved to get the youngling before he could reach Kleeta, but Kleeta made it to the youngling before they did. ""STAY AWAY FROM HIM!"" Kleeta roared at the 2 aberrations. They stepped back, scowling.    ""That's strike 2, Maggot!"" Kleeta gritted her teeth as she simultaneously scooped up the youngling and glared at the aberrations.    ""Mother?"" The youngling nuzzled into Kleeta's breast and, promptly, fell asleep. Kleeta sighed with relief as did Ozymandius and Venerate.    ""WHY do you have it? Shouldn't OUR Lord have the youngling, Kleeta?"" The male aberration sneered. The female aberration cackled with glee. Ozymandius moved towards the aberrations, but Kleeta handed him the youngling.    ""Today? You die."" Kleeta grabbed the male aberration and sank her teeth into his throat, she drank him to the point of dehydration. Once he was completely exsanguinated? She ate the majority of his throat. When she finished? She grabbed the female aberration and repeated her actions. Once the aberrations were gone? Kleeta went to Ozymandius and took the youngling.   Venerate and Ozymandius just looked on.   ""Kleeta? Are you alright?"" Ozymandius was becoming concerned.    ""I'm fine, Ozymandius. I just can't take the way they disrespected you when they knew it's against Atramentarian Law. I didn't even care if they liked you, but they damn sure were going to respect you or die!"" Kleeta felt completely justified in her actions.   ""What now, My Lord?"" Venerate asked Ozymandius.    ""It's time to acclimate and integrate ourselves with the local denizens. Hopefully? We'll even acclimate and integrate with the local gentry."" Ozymandius replied.   Venerate, Kleeta and Ozymandius walked towards the little town of Eerie, Indiana. The residents were unaware of what was about to happen. It wouldn't matter if they did know. After all? Resistance is futile.

15,Maisie's Kisses,14828yd,115,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/14828yd/maisies_kisses/,1000andonenites,"Maisie realised her kisses kill when she was about ten.   She was at the playground with her friend Henry. They ran over the see-saw together, holding hands for some reason. And then by the see-saw, Henry leaned over and kissed her fully on the lips, before letting go of her hand and jumping on the seat. Maisie stood still for a moment, confused, then ran to the other side, raised her arms, gripped the seat, pulled it down and jumped on. Henry went up, and then he fell like a stone with a very loud thud. He lay crumpled on the rubbery pink playground gravel, dead.   They said it was a random heart failure, but Maisie knew better.   After that, she avoided boys. Boys didn't like that, especially as she was a pretty little thing with soft curvy lips, and the more she avoided them, the more they tried to kiss her. There was Jerry, who cornered her in the school cloakroom, and kissed her with a loud smacking sound. She wriggled out of his grasp and dashed out, only to hear once again that loud thud - she knew before she turned around that he was dead, lying lifeless among the stinky sneakers littering the floor. And Michael, who stole a kiss on the bus, just before his stop. He remained alive long enough to reach the door, and then tumbled out, headfirst, onto the pavement below.   And poor Paul. Maisie actually liked Paul, - he was so good-looking with bright sparkly eyes and he was so kind and smart. They did homework together- they both wanted to be doctors. He helped her patiently with maths while she wrote up his essays. He would never kiss her suddenly, when she didn't want it. She hoped desperately that would make a difference, inching closer and closer to him in their study sessions, letting her hand accidentally-on-purpose brush against his, until he asked politely- ‚ÄòMaisie- I've been dying to kiss you. May I?""   She forgot about her curse in her hormonal adolescent delight, and leaned forward with her lips parted and her eyes shining. ""Oh Paul"", she breathed. As his lips pressed softly but firmly against hers, her whole body filled with joy and she could barely let him pull away. They looked deep into each other's eyes, glowing with young love.   And then- she shrieked out in despair as the light dimmed in his eyes. He slumped over, while she sobbed uncontrollably.   She never forgave herself.   She gave up her dream of becoming a doctor, and relentlessly pursued another career, specializing in dealing with unwanted husbands and lovers. A surprisingly lucrative field.      She smiled at her latest prey, Jason, sitting across the restaurant table. She didn't feel bad anymore, those emotions were long gone. She had a job to do, and he shouldn't have asked her out when he was already married, asshole. She leaned in. She was busy, and didn't want to waste too much time on this one.",scarystories,20,2023-06-12 20:43:49
16,The tree,14a5m8l,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/14a5m8l/the_tree/,Single-Perception660," I felt I really needed to share this story. I recently moved into this new neighborhood in upstate New York. Beautiful house, quiet area and all around nice school district. I travel for work, so relocating my self and my family has always been a thing. This time I traveled alone because my wife was ill.  I started noticing some strange activity around this one specific part of my back yard while I was doing some landscaping. Animals would clearly avoid it and it just gave this very disturbing aura. ""Oh well"", I thought to myself and continued working. Yesterday as I was pulling into my driveway I noticed a group of kids around the ages of 12 or so, staring at my house from across the street. I got out of the car and asked them what's up and they were telling me that they saw multiple people in the windows of the house staring back at them and moving from room to room. Laughing it off and assuring them it was all good, I introduced myself and began walking back.  One of the girls stopped me halfway across the street. She informed me she was my next door neighbor and then her features went very still. ""The tree in your backyard gives the twin's nightmares, you should be careful."", she said before running back to join her friends.  That night I was watching tv and unwinding when the thought came across my mind. I went to the the part of the house that had a clear view of the back yard and switched on the light. The tree was still there, yeah it still gave off that creepy vibe, but it was still there and it was still a tree. I decided on turning in early and began walking to my room. As I lay in bed, replaying the exchange  with the neighborhood kids earlier, I began hearing strange sounds coming from the living room.   ""I know I turned the TV off ."" Quietly whispering to myself while getting up to go check just in case. I can be forgetful sometimes, plus the noise helps me sleep on the lonelier nights.   After getting to the living room, seeing the TV was indeed off and making sure I didn't leave anything else on, I headed back to my room and crashed.   I don't recall most of it but I did have a very creepy dream that night. I was standing in what was going to be my sons room screaming at a little girl in the corner. She didn't move, she just had her back turned to me and stood there silent. I woke up to a loud bang and found myself on the floor in my sons room. Weird, I know, but I just hopped up and carried on about my day and tried to push my sleep waking episode out of my mind.   Today I was off work and decided to check out the archives. I headed to city hall and the library to find any records on my house and the area that I stayed in. Everything pretty much came up empty with the exception of the tree located in my backyard, nothing creepy or off-putting so I headed home.  After I got home and had some lunch, I heard a knock on the door. A man who said he was my neighbor, introduced himself and Johnathan but told me to call him Jona stood at the front door and welcomed me to the neighborhood. He held up a bottle of whiskey and some steaks and asked to come in. Invited him in and we began chopping it up over a few glasses. He was telling me about the neighborhood and his family, nice bunch of people by the way, and even invited me to an MMA event that he had an extra ticket to. We went out back to grill up the steaks and talk some more when he stopped mid sentence and stared at the tree.  ""Be careful around that thing, it gives my kids nightmares and damn sure creeps me the fuck out."", he said coldly.   It was a bit of an awkward moment so I shook it off and continued the conversation. We finished up grilling and ate, he said he had free time for me to pick his mind before it got dark. My curiosity was piqued so I asked him about the tree and the house. Starting off with the house he told me that he originally wanted to move here but his wife and children were terrified of the backyard for some unknown reason so they moved next door and that people would come check it out but their reasoning for not taking the house was the backyard, specifically the tree in the backyard. He then began telling me a story about the last owner of the house. Let's call him Tim. Apparently Tim had only lived in the house for about a few weeks before fleeing frantically. He described Tim as a nice guy with a very energetic dog. There was one incident where he tried to get the tree cut down and the equipment malfunctioned causing one of the younger workers to lose their hand. Another incident in which Tims dog ended up dying under the tree. After that he'd seen him in the backyard trying to cut the tree down and eventually giving up after breaking multiple tools.  The next day, he was gone. Then Jona's face got really dark, the same as the girl's from yesterday. I can see the resemblance now. He told me about the gates randomly shaking on very still days and the random pounding of footsteps on the grass at night as if people were running around my backyard. His wife would hear whispers coming from the house before I moved in. They would see random figures walking around in broad daylight, but the house was locked completely. ""Scared yet?"",  he chuckled. My face must have given him the impression that I was getting a bit uncomfortable. It was getting dark and he said he needed to get home. I walked him to the door and asked him about the MMA event, we made our plans and also agreed to hangout more. ""See ya later man, hopefully you last longer than Tim and like I said before, be careful around that thing."", he called back, as he walked into his yard.  In my time typing up this story, a very creepy feeling of being watched washed over me. I looked outside towards the tree and seen it swaying, although there isn't any wind today. There's also a rhythmic stomping coming from the room that would be my sons. I'm trying to ignore it, but it keeps getting louder and louder. I wonder if this is what Tim experienced. The dreams are becoming more and more frequent. The footsteps are becoming louder and I keep waking up in different parts of the house with scars or a setting pain behind my eyes. I'm beginning to think moving here wasn't a great idea. I'm more afraid for my family",scarystories,0,2023-06-15 11:39:48

I could smell the shampoo in her hair, see the emerald spikes in her eyes. No one would've seen it coming, right? That's what I tell myself, anyways. This particular day, she was wearing a black t-shirt paired with light blue denim shorts. She was always so confident. I walked up to her this day, and tried talking to her. I don't understand why she pushed me away, I didn't do anything. She had started screaming at me, and I don't know why. What had I done? Was it the time I followed her home and took her bra? The time I sat in her window watching her sleep for hours? Or maybe that time I messaged her declaring my love for her? I've been so very nice to her, and she treats me like that. She should've been nicer. She SHOULDVE BEEN NICER.    I didn't wanna do it. I didn't mean to hurt her. I should've given her some anesthesia, maybe then she wouldn't have screamed and cried. Thankfully my basement is sound proof. No one heard as I peeled back her skin. I want to be inside her skin. I ripped it all off, boy that must've hurt with the constant drip coming from the ceiling. In truth, I didn't want to hurt her, I just wanted to make a being who loved and wanted me. I took her limbs, eyes, and lips. All I had to do was add them to the body pillow with the skin. Now I have my own girlfriend who will LOVE me. Maybe she can go to class for her...",scarystories,0,2023-06-15 05:56:13
20,My girlfriend was peeking at me,149unzo,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/149unzo/my_girlfriend_was_peeking_at_me/,Clear_Farmer_4624,"I sat alone in my dimly lit bedroom, engrossed in a horror novel that sent chills down my spine. The atmosphere was heavy with anticipation, every creak of the floorboards magnified by my overactive imagination. Little did I know that the true terror was about to unfold right before my eyes.  As I turned the page, a sudden draft sent a shiver down my spine, causing the hairs on the back of my neck to stand on end. The room felt colder, the air heavier. A sense of unease washed over me, as if I were being watched. I glanced around, expecting to see nothing but the familiar surroundings of my room.  But then I saw her, standing in the shadows, her silhouette barely visible against the darkness. My girlfriend. Or at least, it appeared to be her. A chill ran through me, my heart racing in my chest. What was she doing there, lurking in the darkness?  Her eyes, once filled with warmth and affection, now seemed vacant, devoid of emotion. A twisted smile slowly formed on her lips, sending a wave of terror crashing over me. It was as if a stranger had replaced the person I thought I knew so well. Panic surged through my veins, urging me to flee, but my body remained frozen in fear.  She stepped closer, each movement slow and deliberate, as if savoring the terror she evoked. I could hear the echoes of her footsteps, a haunting rhythm that echoed in the depths of my mind. The air grew thick with an indescribable energy, as if the very fabric of reality was unraveling.  A flickering light bulb cast eerie shadows across her face, revealing twisted features that bore no resemblance to the woman I loved. Her eyes glowed with an unnatural intensity, an otherworldly presence that sent shivers down my spine. It was as if something had taken control of her, transforming her into a vessel of darkness.  I mustered the courage to speak, my voice trembling. ""Wh-what are you doing?"" I managed to stammer, my words barely audible in the suffocating silence.  Her voice, once gentle and soothing, now carried an eerie undertone. It was a voice I didn't recognize, cold and detached. ""I've always been watching you,"" she whispered, her voice carrying a disturbing certainty. ""Every secret, every thought, laid bare before me.""  A surge of terror coursed through my veins, my mind racing for an escape. But she seemed to anticipate my every move, blocking any path to safety. The room grew smaller, the walls closing in around me, as if the very space conspired against my survival.  In a final act of desperation, I bolted toward the door, only to find it locked. Panic seized me as I frantically tried to open it, my fingers slipping on the doorknob. I turned to face her, her sinister grin widening. ""There's no escape,"" she hissed, her voice echoing in the confined space.  And then, as suddenly as she appeared, she vanished into thin air, leaving me trembling and alone. The room returned to its normal state, the shadows retreating, but the horror of that encounter remained etched in my memory.  From that day forward, I couldn't help but question everything. Was it a mere hallucination? A product of my overactive imagination? Or had I truly witnessed a glimpse into the darkness lurking within the person I loved? The uncertainty haunted me, forever casting a shadow over our once idyllic relationship.",scarystories,1,2023-06-15 02:18:28
21,A scary story,149ugyy,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/149ugyy/a_scary_story/,Clear_Farmer_4624," Once upon a time, in a small, isolated village nestled deep within a dense forest, there was a legend that sent shivers down the spines of the villagers. They spoke in hushed tones about the Whispering Shadows, a malevolent presence that haunted their very existence.  Legend had it that the Whispering Shadows were once innocent souls who perished tragically in the forest. Their spirits, consumed by anger and sorrow, were trapped in the shadows, eternally seeking vengeance. As the sun dipped below the horizon, the villagers would lock their doors, drawing the curtains tightly, for they knew the darkness brought the lurking presence of the Whispering Shadows.  One fateful night, a curious traveler named Ethan arrived in the village, unaware of the chilling legends that plagued the villagers. He sought refuge in an old, creaking inn, its walls adorned with faded paintings that seemed to stare with hollow eyes. The innkeeper warned him to be cautious, but Ethan dismissed the tales as mere folklore.  As the night wore on, Ethan found himself unable to sleep, plagued by an unsettling feeling. The air grew heavy, and an eerie silence engulfed the inn. Suddenly, a faint whisper echoed through the corridors, chilling Ethan to the core. He rose from his bed, his heart pounding in his chest, and followed the haunting whispers down a dimly lit hallway.  The whispers led Ethan to a hidden room at the end of the corridor, where an ancient mirror stood, covered in dust and neglect. Trembling, he cautiously approached it, his reflection distorted by the passage of time. As he peered into the mirror, the room's temperature plummeted, and a frigid wind swept through the chamber, rustling the pages of forgotten books.  Ethan's reflection morphed into a twisted, sinister visage, mirroring the agony and despair of the trapped souls. The Whispering Shadows materialized from the mirror, their shadowy forms twisting and contorting in the dim light. Desperate to escape their wrath, Ethan stumbled backward, but the room seemed to conspire against him, its walls closing in as if to seal his fate.  In a moment of clarity, Ethan realized he had unwittingly unleashed the dormant spirits that plagued the village for centuries. The Whispering Shadows converged upon him, their ghostly hands reaching out, clawing at his soul. The echoes of their anguished cries reverberated through the room, becoming one with Ethan's own screams of terror.  Days later, the villagers discovered the inn, long abandoned and plagued by an impenetrable darkness. They found no trace of Ethan, his presence swallowed by the eternal torment of the Whispering Shadows. From that day forward, the villagers lived in fear, forever haunted by the chilling legend that became a terrifying reality.  And so, the village remained trapped in the clutches of the Whispering Shadows, a cautionary tale that echoed through the ages, serving as a chilling reminder of the consequences of curiosity and the horrors that lie within the shadows.",scarystories,1,2023-06-15 02:07:19

24,It‚Äôs mine.,149pxkw,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/149pxkw/its_mine/,Laurenzobenzo,"As a small child in the 90s, my Batman bike was my prized possession. It was beautiful. Black and blue, with an oval, glow in the dark Bat logo attached to the front of the handlebars. My sister and I spent hours looping around our basement, hurrying past the ""scary part,"" an unfinished area filled with storage boxes and Nordictrac equipment scarcely used. Our home had been built in the 1920s. It creaked and slanted and felt ""lived in,"" by us and by others.   I was in the lead that Saturday morning. I turned the corner and entered the ""scary part."" I told myself to be cool. Be brave. Nothing was there. Until there was.  In a sea of cardboard boxes, something stood out. A face. A boy.   *""STOP! It's mine!""*  He pointed at my bike.  *""That is mine.""*  I spun out, into the wall. Moments later, my sister caught up with me.   *""Why'd you crash, sissy?""*  I grabbed her hand and ran upstairs as fast as my wobbly legs allowed.   My dad said it was an imaginary friend I hadn't met yet.   *""Introduce yourself,""* he said with a smile. *""Maybe he's like Champ.""*  Champ was my invisible German Shepherd friend.  *""I don't think he's like Champ,""* I whispered in his ear, afraid the boy might hear.  He patted me on the head and told me to go and play.  ‚Äî‚Äî  That night, I tossed and turned. I was afraid, and then I was angry.   *""It ISN'T his. It's mine! What if he takes it while I'm asleep?""*  I grabbed my color changing flashlight and crept downstairs. Darkness permeated every corner of the den. It was a different house at night.   Flashlight on, I tiptoed down the basement steps. We didn't have a light switch on the wall. Instead, a single bulb with a long string dangled just out of my reach. I was too scared to find the step ladder. I felt eyes on me as I turned the corner, the ""scary part"" illuminated only by the light of the moon in the window.   *""I had a bike.""*  The boy. I didn't see him. It sounded like he was everywhere and nowhere.   *""It was mine.""*  And there, in the retired rocking chair from my sister's nursery, he sat. Rocking gently. Back and forth. I steadied myself.  *""Listen... I don't want you to think that my bike is yours. It's mine. I got it for my birthday and I just wanted you to know.""*  The rocking stopped.  I wanted to run. My legs were stuck to the floor. He smiled.  *""Are you my friend?""*  The way he said it unsettled me, like he was daring me to say ""no.""  *""Um... If you're nice, we can be friends. Are you nice?""*  He started rocking again.  *""I can be nice. Are we friends?""*  I nodded.  *""Good,""* he said with a smile. *""Friends share.*""  And he was gone. The chill I hadn't noticed until that moment seemed to dissipate. I ran like I was being chased all the way back to my bed. Two words filled my head in the darkness:  *""Friends share.""*  I kept my flashlight on all night.   ‚Äî‚Äî  I found my Bat bike wedged behind my Mom's crafting table and a box labeled: KITCHEN CRAP (DONATE.) I knew it wasn't my doing. My sister and I parked our bikes by our blanket fort. We'd even made a ""driveway"" and labeled parking spots out of construction paper and sparkly markers.   *""Friends share.""*  Every morning for a month, I'd find my bike in random places around the basement. Once, after I'd searched everywhere, my dad found it in turned upside down, perched precariously on a stack of boxes too tall for me to reach.  *""Be more careful with your stuff, kiddo! How'd you even manage to do this?""* He laughed. I faked a smile and made up an excuse.  The boy was drawn to me like a moth to a flame. My sister believed me but she never saw him. I was glad about both.   Before long, my sister, and our friends, would ""lose"" toys at our house. Every play date, something went missing. My best friend never found his Nerf slingshot. We'd been playing with it moments before it vanished.   But my Batman bike was the boy's favorite.   ‚Äî‚Äî  I grew up. Memories faded like old photographs. Five years ago, my wife and I had a son. His birthday was in May. I surprised him with a Paw Patrol bike. He was so excited. He lived on that thing.  Until last week, when the rhythmic *""thum thump""* of his wheels rolling on and off the carpet in the hallway came to an abrupt halt. I leaned back in my office chair and craned my neck, partially revealing the dim hallway. At the end of the hall stood my son, his back to me.  *""No!""* he screamed, startling me. He stomped his little foot.  *""It's mine.""*",scarystories,6,2023-06-14 22:08:59

26,The Bad Place,149nnzz,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/149nnzz/the_bad_place/,TormentedTales,"The Bad Place. That's what the locals in my small town call the woods that circle our little slice of paradise.   There are many different rumors that the residents murmur about to each other but I don't think anybody really knows what waits in those woods.   Devil cults, child eating witches, creatures from beyond and even aliens are some of the theories that float about.   They are all bullshit if you ask me. But what isn't bullshit is those woods have definitely earned their nickname; The Bad Place.   Hikers have entered and have never come out, kids have dared each other to enter and vanished, dogs and cats have run off into the woods just to never be seen again.   If you stick to town, you're safe. The only rule is don't go too deep into the Bad Place or you'll just become another statistic.   I live in a small house just on the outskirts of town. There's an entry to the Bad Place about a hundred feet from my front doorstep.   At night I keep my door locked and shotgun by my side, ready to fire at anything that comes from those woods. Nothing ever has except for sounds, horrible sounds.   The sounds of children screaming and crying out for help. I think it's the trees. Once the woods have you, they become you and can even communicate with you.   That's just speculation but it's the only thing that makes sense. Their cries nearly tricked me the first time I heard them.   I've told the local sheriff and his deputy but it always falls on deaf ears. They're just as terrified as the rest of us. Who can blame them?   Bo, my six year old chocolate lab, sleeps in my room every night. He whimpers when the wind blows at night.   I'll never forget my journey into the Bad Place. The night Bo got out and chased after a monstrous Buck into the woods. This wasn't a regular looking Buck either.   He had red beady eyes with torn up flesh hanging from his body and crooked antlers that were broken in half and dangled loosely.   I grabbed my shotgun, flashlight and started towards the Bad Place. I moved as quickly as I could. It still surprises me today that I wasn't more reluctant at the time.   The wind became cold as I progressed deeper into the woods. The trees grew closer together and the woods began to swallow me.   A sinking feeling filled the pit of my stomach. My heart pounded in my chest like a drum. I was terrified and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't call out Bo's name. My throat tightened more and more every time I tried.   I managed to cry out to the woods... and they answered me. The dense trees suddenly started to open and spread apart from one another like a crowd allowing someone to pass. The wind quickly ceased. It was quiet. The woods had become eerily still.   There was no signs of Bo anywhere. I looked in every direction. And then... a whimper. I followed the whimpering to a pile of tree limbs. Bo was lying near it.   A strong gust of wind blew, knocking me to the ground. I gasped as I landed on my back. The wind entered me and filled me.   Bo and I ran back to our little cabin. I never spoke a word about going into the woods because I fear how people would've reacted.   For the first few months things were normal. And then it all started... the nightmares, the visions, and the transformation.   My nightmares started to become extremely vivid. They varied in context but all had a similar ending. It always ended with the woods taking me back.   The visions became increasingly horrifying with each passing day. It went from hearing children crying to seeing their dead mutilated bodies wrapped in tree vines. They stalked me wherever I went. It got so bad I had to move from my cabin to an apartment in a bigger city.   I can still hear the woods calling me back. The trees whisper my name and the wind blows for me. The Bad Place is in complete control now. I can feel it in my heart. I know it in my mind.   There's something growing inside of me. I can feel it moving in my stomach. The pain is shooting to the rest of my body. My skin has started to dry up and become a wood-like texture, flaking off in good sized pieces.   Maybe I should go back. Maybe I should give it what it wants... me.",scarystories,0,2023-06-14 20:19:37

Back in 2020 I started my tiktok account, where I would stream 24/7. Most of my streams were just me searching for these folklore creatures, trying to prove they didn't exist. One night, I was doing a stream like normal, I was searching the Appalachian mountains. I had heard a lot about the strange occurances and wanted to see for myself. My stream stared normal, I introduced myself told them where we were and started exploring.   Soon the wind started to pick up, I got colder. The wind started to sound like it was calling my name. Shadows moved in the corners of my eyes, the wind continued to call my name ""John John John"" The wind picked up drastically, I blamed my paranoia, the darkness of the forest. My feet warmed, my body preparing itself for temperature of the cold, they got hotter and hotter.  my feet  themselves, my stream was not on my mind in the moment, I felt dizzy, my eyes blurred. The wind chanted my name more and more. The tone had changed, the wind now more forceful. My phone dropped onto the slippery snow, the notifications I could barely here over the strong. The notifications keep blaring but by now I'm long gone.   I run, trying to get the burning sensation off my feet. My feet take me deeper into the forest, I pass a sign ""Warning"" is the only thing I read as I run. Closer and closer to the chant of the winds.   ""Help, help"" my mind chants but my feet do not listen. My feet no longer touch the ground, I ascend into the darkness of the night sky. My body burns, my eyes burn, my face burns, my feet burn. What would happened if I chose a different path in life? Would I still meet the fate? If had believed in them, would I be able to avoid it? Would I be able to free myself from an endless guilt? I drop, I ascend into ashes.   I appear in darkness, a voice speaks and echoes around me. Muut, comes to me shows mercy upon my soul. I am here today to share my story, Do not end up with a life like mine. A life full of guilt, do not test the element and their power over the world. Even if don't believe it, continue to try and avoid it. You might not believe in it, but that doesn't mean it's not real. Sometimes you realise that too late.",scarystories,2,2023-06-14 17:59:16
31,An Airbnb Experience I'll Never Forget,149jq4s,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/149jq4s/an_airbnb_experience_ill_never_forget/,Scared_Sorbet4483,"The city had been suffocating me. The constant noise, the never-ending hustle, and the relentless pressure, they were all taking a toll on my mental health. I was just 32, but I felt decades older. So, I decided to escape, to a place where silence was the loudest noise, where the pace of life was dictated by the rising and setting of the sun.  I found a quaint little Airbnb in the countryside, an idyllic log cabin surrounded by acres of dense woods, far away from the maddening crowd. TBH, it seemed like a dream. But little did I know, it was a nightmare in disguise.  Upon my arrival, the cabin appeared as charming as the pictures - rustic, isolated, and peaceful. But as the sun began to set, the cabin started revealing its true colors.  At first, it was the little things. The way the wooden floor creaked under my feet, even when I was standing still. The peculiar smell that lingered in the air, sweet yet metallic. The way the wind howled through the trees, almost like a mournful cry.  Then, I started noticing the oddities. The mirrors in the cabin didn't reflect my image correctly. My reflection was always slightly delayed, as if it were another person mimicking my movements. The paintings on the walls seemed to shift when I looked away, their subjects twisting into grotesque figures.  As the night fell, I heard whispers. Soft, eerie whispers that seemed to come from the walls themselves. They spoke of sorrow, of loss, and of something darker that I dared not contemplate.  Then came the figure. Every night, at the stroke of midnight, I could see it in the window - a silhouette standing in the woods, watching. It was always there, unmoving, just watching.  Despite the terror that gripped me, I couldn't bring myself to leave. It was as if the cabin had ensnared me in its eerie charm. Every day, I would tell myself, ""OMG, I'm leaving tomorrow,"" but when tomorrow came, I found myself drawn further into the mystery of the cabin.  What is this place? What secrets does it hold? Why does it not let me go? The questions consumed me, fuelling my curiosity and fear in equal measure. But I was determined to uncover the truth, or be consumed by it.  Days turned into weeks. I found myself weirdly drawn deeper into the hypnotic rhythm of the cabin. The whispers grew louder, the figure in the woods seemed closer, and the cabin's oddities became more pronounced.  One day, I found a trapdoor under a worn-out rug. It led to a basement I hadn't known existed. The air was damp, filled with the scent of old earth and something... else. A smell that made my stomach churn. It was the same sweet yet metallic smell I'd noticed when I first arrived.  In the dim light, I could see something etched into the stone walls. Symbols, old and unfamiliar, crisscrossed the surface in a pattern that made my head spin. The same symbols were carved into a wooden pedestal at the center of the room, upon which sat an old, leather-bound book.  As I approached the book, the whispers grew into a cacophony. I could hear distinct words now - a chant, repeating the same phrase over and over. I couldn't understand it, but I felt a pull, a compulsion to open the book.  With trembling hands, I opened it. The pages were yellowed with age, covered in the same symbols from the walls. But there, in the middle of the book, was a picture that made my blood run cold.  It was the cabin. And standing by the window was a figure, the same figure I saw every night. But in the book, the figure wasn't outside the cabin, it was inside, staring directly at me.  I recoiled in horror, dropping the book. The room plunged into silence. I could feel a presence behind me. I didn't want to turn around, didn't want to see what I knew was there. But I had to. I turned...  I turned around, and there it was. The figure. It was no longer a silhouette but a clear, ghastly apparition. It was as if someone had taken a snapshot of despair and moulded it into a humanoid shape. It reached out for me with a hand that was both there and not there.  My instincts screamed at me to run, but my feet were rooted to the spot. I was a statue, a prisoner of my own fear. The apparition's hand touched my face. It was ice-cold, yet it burned. As it did, I felt a wave of emotions flood into me - sadness, anger, fear, despair. These weren't my emotions; they were its.  Suddenly, I was somewhere else. I was still in the cabin, but it was different - alive, filled with people. I was seeing through someone else's eyes, feeling their emotions, living their memories. I was the apparition.  I saw the cabin as it was - not a building, but a prison, a place of punishment for those who dared to challenge the natural order. The apparition, I realized, was not a ghost, but a prisoner, trapped in the cabin for an eternity.  The memories became darker, filled with pain and sorrow. I felt every moment of the apparition's loneliness, every second of its despair. It was too much. I screamed, or at least I thought I did. The next thing I knew, I was back in the basement, the apparition gone.  I left the cabin the next morning. As I walked away, I could still feel its gaze on me, but it was different. It was no longer a gaze of menace but of gratitude. I had shared its pain, its solitude. I had given it something it hadn't had in a long time - company.  As I left, I glanced back one last time. There, in the window, stood the figure, watching me leave. But this time, it wasn't alone. Standing next to it was another figure - a familiar one. It was me.  I had left the cabin, but a part of me would always remain, trapped in the eerie solitude, forever sharing the cabin's haunting secret.  Update : I've been back in the city for a few weeks now. The noise, the chaos, it's all the same, but I'm different. The cabin changed me, in ways I'm still trying to understand.  Every night, I dream of the cabin, of the figure in the window. But it's not a nightmare, it's almost... comforting. It's a strange feeling, being connected to something so far away, so different from my own reality.  I've started writing. I felt a compulsion to share my experiences, to tell the world about the cabin and its prisoner. Reddit seemed like the right place.  The stories seem to resonate with people. They're drawn to the fear, the mystery, the unknown. But for me, it's more than just stories. It's catharsis. It's a way for me to understand what happened, to make sense of my encounter with the supernatural.",scarystories,1,2023-06-14 17:28:51
34,"My response to the viral r/AskReddit ""What is a secret that would ruin your life, if revealed?""",149gryy,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/149gryy/my_response_to_the_viral_raskreddit_what_is_a/,Geniusername,"So where do I begin? Well, let's just say this story is quite messed up. I'n having to post it on here for a number of reasons (which I cba to explain)...  It all started a couple years ago with the rise of this virus. You guys aren't familiar with this virus. It was called Dentearvirus 64. The origin of the virus remains unknown, the virus itself, remains unknown (as of today), however... When it was known, it wasn't pleasant and was theorised to be caused by a scientific experiment gone wrong. Of course, scientists are innocent in all this.   How do I know? I'll explain that later, my friend. Right now, I want to clarify that I am far from innocent. I have confessed the bad role I played in this to someone, but they conveniently forgot everything I told them. I chose a moment in where I was hungry, to spill the big secret.  Anyways, the important thing is to cherish your memories. The more cherished they are, the brighter and more fulfilling they become. You may even realise your fulfilled memories could play a positive impact on other people's lives.  Ugh, I do this all the time. I apologise for beating around the bush. The truth is, I didn't create the virus.  Instead, it created me in a crazy kinda way. It enabled me by giving me a really strange superpower, one that is rather evil. Of course, everybody else got the annoying, life threatening symptoms, but no superpowers. I know it sounds absurd, but let me explain.   My superpower is causing memory loss (I can't believe I'm confessing this to the public)... And additionally, sometimes even dementia. Did I invent dementia? No, don't be ridiculous. However, I am more than capable to give dementia to someone, if they catch me on a hungry day.  What do I gain from this ability? Well, the virus has made it so that I can only derive sustenance and vitality from memories. It doesn't make much sense, I admit, but please trust me. However, I do have an appetite for this peculiar diet, so you'll be safe reading this post. Well, most of you, anyways. If you want to test whether or not I've taken a piece of your mind, try recalling what this post was about later today. See if you can even remember reading it. Eight out of ten of you will pass this test. Crazy, I know.  As for the truth behind the Dentearvirus 64, it was revealed, and it is indeed incredibly disturbing. The revelation led to many tragic events, including suicides. Yes... it was that disturbing. The truth turned out to be far more complex than it seems.  But how did I erase this knowledge? Why don't you know about it? You knew before, but now you don't. Well, I collaborated with an elite group to suppress this information. They provided me with extraordinary supplements to enhance my appetite, and I consumed all the memories. They deleted the files, the YouTube videos, the podcasts, the streams featuring people succumbing to despair from their own mind (after discovering the truth)... And last but not least, the virus itself.   Now, no one will know about the chaos unfolding behind the scenes and the crazy shit that once consumed the world.   ""But wait,"" you might say, ""you're revealing it right now!"" Yes, indeed, my dear genius. However, this is all taking place on a fictional subreddit dedicated to fabricated stories. It's the perfect cover-up! I'm just joking, guys. See? It's as simple as that. Now, if you believe me, you might appear a little crazy. But maybe you are right for believing me. Or maybe you're not. But then again, maybe you are. Or maybe you're not.",scarystories,0,2023-06-14 15:30:30
35,STAY INSIDE : SURVIVING THE UNSEEN APOCALYPSE,149elve,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/149elve/stay_inside_surviving_the_unseen_apocalypse/,Scared_Sorbet4483,"EMERGENCY ALERT.  Please be advised, this is not a drill. As of 12:34 EST, there has been a nationwide security breach. All citizens must stay in their homes, avoid all windows, and keep all entrances securely locked. Do not, under any circumstances, answer your door. If you hear voices of known individuals, disregard them. They are not what they seem. Stay tuned for further updates.  I stared at the notification on my phone. Nationwide security breach? Was this some kind of prank? But emergency alerts weren't exactly known for their humor. I switched on the TV just in time for the emergency broadcast to fill the screen. The same warning echoed from the speakers, the announcer's voice straining with restrained panic.  I'm not much for freaking out. You could say I have a cool head. But damn, this was eerie. I went to lock the doors, drew the blinds, and gathered some essential supplies to hunker down in my windowless home office. Just as I was setting up camp, my phone buzzed with another message.  EMERGENCY ALERT.  This is a follow-up advisory. The nationwide security breach involves unidentified entities impersonating familiar individuals. Do not interact with these entities. They have shown aggressive and potentially deadly behavior. Keep your phones charged, stay away from windows, and stay in your rooms.  Man, this was turning into some Twilight Zone episode. I couldn't help but wonder, was this happening everywhere? I shot a message to a buddy of mine in London. To my surprise, he responded almost immediately, confirming he'd received a similar warning.  Just then, I heard a soft tap on the front door. ""Hey, it's me, Jake,"" called a voice that I recognized as my neighbor's. The dude I usually borrow a beer with on weekends. But the alert's warning was clear. ""Sorry Jake,"" I said loudly enough to be heard, ""I can't open the door.""  Soon, more voices came. Voices of friends, family, ex-girlfriends I hadn't spoken to in years. Each voice was perfectly mimicked, their pleads becoming increasingly desperate. Amid the growing chaos outside, my phone buzzed again.  EMERGENCY ALERT.  Unidentified entities are not contained. Do not, under any circumstances, leave your secure location. Any attempt to use transportation or communication devices besides the emergency alert system may attract their attention. The situation is currently being handled. Stay inside. Stay safe.  Well, there goes my plan to call mom. Sitting alone in my makeshift fortress, I could only wait. The phantom voices continued for hours, then days. The occasional scream in the distance made my blood run cold. Anarchy outside my door, and all I could do was sit tight.  The days blurred into weeks. Every so often, a new alert would ping, each one grimmer than the last. The entities were everywhere, impersonating everyone. I began to feel like the last man on Earth. My only tether to reality, the relentless emergency alerts.  Finally, after weeks of this madness, a new alert chimed.  EMERGENCY ALERT.  The nationwide security breach has been contained. It is safe to leave your homes. Please report any unusual activities to your local authorities. Do not approach any individual displaying unusual behavior. We are stronger together.  As the alert ended, a profound silence filled my house. The voices were gone, replaced by an unsettling quiet. I cautiously unlocked the door and stepped outside. My neighborhood was unrecognizable, houses abandoned, some burnt down to the ground.  Relieved, yet mourning the world that was lost, I decided to head back inside. I still had a home, a fortress that kept me safe during the apocalypse. But just as I was about to close the door, I saw Jake, my neighbor, walking towards me.  ""Hey, buddy! Hell of a few weeks, huh?"" he greeted me with his usual jovial tone. But something was off. His gait was too rigid, his smile too stiff. Then it struck me - the alert's warning - Do not approach any individual displaying unusual behavior.  ""No kidding, Jake. Good to see you,"" I replied, keeping my voice steady. ""I just need to grab something inside. One sec.""  Without waiting for a reply, I quickly shut the door. My heart pounded in my chest. The ordeal wasn't over. Not by a long shot.  EMERGENCY ALERT.  It's not over. The threat has evolved. Stay alert. Trust no one.  After that, days turned into weeks, weeks into months. The world began to rebuild itself. Every survivor had to adjust to the new normal - a world where trust was a scarce commodity. But we learned, we adapted, and we survived.  In this new world, I remained ever vigilant. My cozy suburban house became my fortress, my sanctuary in an uncertain world. Every knock, every voice outside was met with skepticism. And every day, I found a way to keep going.  I'm still here, still surviving. Every day brings its own challenges, but hey, it's better than the alternative. My life might be filled with endless emergency alerts and nights of unease, but I am alive.  And in this brave new world, that's the best anyone can hope for.",scarystories,2,2023-06-14 14:03:09
36,The mcnightmare,149dze9,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/149dze9/the_mcnightmare/,Scared_Sorbet4483,"I have always been a loyal customer of McDonald's, indulging in their greasy delights without a second thought. Little did I know that my seemingly innocent visits to the golden arches would soon turn into a waking nightmare.  It started with a chance encounter. As I sat alone, enjoying my meal, I noticed a figure in the corner of my eye. A man, nondescript in appearance, sat at a nearby table, fixated on me with an unsettling intensity. Unease crept through my veins, but I brushed it off as mere paranoia.  Days turned into weeks, and with each visit to McDonald's, the man was there, lurking in the shadows. His presence was suffocating, his gaze piercing through me like a thousand needles. I tried to confront him once, but he vanished without a trace, leaving only an eerie sense of dread in his wake.  The situation escalated when I started receiving cryptic messages, both online and in handwritten notes. They detailed my daily routine, my deepest fears, and even whispered secrets I had long forgotten. The stalker knew everything about me, invading my privacy with a perverse pleasure.  Fear consumed me. Sleepless nights turned into a living hell as I became a prisoner of my own terror. McDonald's, once a haven of comfort, transformed into a haunting labyrinth where I could never escape the clutches of my tormentor.  One fateful evening, I decided to confront the man head-on. I waited for him outside the restaurant, fueled by a mix of desperation and anger. As he emerged from the shadows, a wicked smile etched across his face, I realized the true depth of my mistake.  In a flash of darkness, he lunged at me, overpowering me with an inhuman strength. The world blurred as I fought against his grip, but his grasp tightened, suffocating my very existence. And then, everything went black.  I awoke in a cold, dimly lit room, chained to a rusted metal chair. The stalker revealed his twisted obsession, reveling in my fear and pain. His voice, a chilling whisper, promised that my suffering would be eternal.  To this day, I remain trapped in that wretched place, my screams echoing through the desolate halls. The golden arches have become a symbol of terror, a reminder of the never-ending torment I endure",scarystories,2,2023-06-14 13:38:00

Among the countless TikTok Live streams, one particular stream caught my attention. The title simply read, ""A Midnight Stroll."" Intrigued, I tapped on it, unknowingly opening the door to a world of horror. The stream depicted a man silently traversing through a desolate forest. The eerie atmosphere was suffocating, with darkness seemingly swallowing the lone figure.  To my utter shock, as the livestream continued, the man's path led him to a familiar place‚Äîmy backyard. I couldn't believe my eyes. It was my house. How could this be possible? Fear gripped my heart, and I immediately dialed the emergency services, desperately hoping they could provide some answers.  The police arrived swiftly, but to my dismay, they found nothing out of the ordinary in the woods. Without any concrete evidence or immediate danger, they dismissed my claims.  I figured that this account would probably go live again, and when it does, I'll screen record and get some proof. It took some time, but eventually, the livestream resumed. Unfortunately for me this time, however, it did not reveal my house. Just hours of this man walking through the woods at night.  ""Why are people even watching this?"" I thought to myself.  The livestream that night was a bust. This man didn't do anything out of the ordinary besides, you know, being a weirdo walking through the woods at night.  I anxiously waited for the livestream to return. After two days, the account finally went live again, and this time, I was prepared. I started to screen record, determined to capture the proof I so desperately needed.  The stream unfolded just as before. The mysterious man paced through the dark woods, his footsteps crunching unsuspecting leaves. The sound of crickets could be distinctly heard. The man emerged from the depths of the forest, his gaze fixed on my house. But this time, something was different. He started moving towards my house, step by step, drawing closer to me. The fear that had gripped me earlier escalated to sheer terror. I knew I had to take action.  My fight-or-flight response activated, and I descended the stairs from my room, making my way to the kitchen window, never taking my eyes off the livestream. I peered into the darkness, searching for any signs of the man approaching my house. But to my horror, I saw nothing.  I looked back down at my phone and then back up to the window, and back down at my phone again. The man was continuing to walk towards my house in the livestream, but I didn't see him in real time.  The realization struck me like a lightning bolt.  The livestream had a delay‚Äîit had to have a stream delay. I watched him approach my backdoor on my phone.

The Titanoboa, an enormous serpent that once ruled the prehistoric world, had somehow survived the eons and continued to haunt the shadows of this unexplored realm. Whispers of its existence had spread among the indigenous tribes who lived on the fringes of the rainforest. They spoke of a serpent so colossal that it could swallow a man whole, leaving no trace behind. They warned their children never to venture too deep into the rainforest, for the Titanoboa was said to be an omen of death, a relentless predator that struck from the darkness. One fateful evening, a group of adventurous explorers arrived on the outskirts of the rainforest. Drawn by tales of hidden treasures and forgotten mysteries, they gathered their gear and prepared to embark on an expedition that would test their courage like never before. Guided by a seasoned local tracker named Diego, the explorers set foot into the rainforest, their hearts filled with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. As they ventured deeper, the oppressive humidity clung to their skin, and the sounds of unseen creatures echoed through the trees, creating an eerie symphony of nature's hidden terrors. Days turned into weeks as they navigated the labyrinthine trails, hacking their way through tangled undergrowth and crossing treacherous rivers teeming with unseen dangers. With each passing day, their exhaustion grew, but their determination remained unyielding. One fateful night, as the moon cast an ethereal glow through the dense canopy, their camp came alive with whispers. The tracker, Diego, sat huddled with the explorers, recounting the legends of the Titanoboa, his voice trembling with a mixture of fear and reverence. ""It's said to be a creature of immense proportions,"" Diego whispered, his eyes darting nervously. ""An ancient predator that slithers through the underbrush, waiting patiently for its unsuspecting prey. It strikes swiftly and silently, crushing its victims with a strength that defies belief."" The explorers exchanged uneasy glances, their hearts quickening with each word. The rainforest seemed to grow darker, the shadows deepening as if in response to the tale.  Days turned into nights, and the explorers pressed on, their curiosity overriding their fear. They stumbled upon remnants of long-lost civilizations, overgrown temples, and crumbling statues that spoke of a forgotten era. Yet, the Titanoboa remained elusive, a ghostly presence lingering just beyond their reach.  I'll post the rest in the comments",scarystories,6,2023-06-14 07:24:45
40,House On The Hill,14954og,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/14954og/house_on_the_hill/,Verrgasm,"There's an old abandoned house perched atop a stubby hill not too far from where I grew up. The greenish outer paint all flaked and its untended yard long since overgrown with weeds, it looms above the rest and looks down upon the surrounding modern homes littered around on all sides. A relic of a time gone past, many in the local community have always considered it an eyesore. A problem to be dealt with in order to pave the way for something new, something worthwhile. It's sat empty for many years, longer than I've even been alive, and remarkably enough it seemed to be left entirely untouched by vandals.  I always marveled at it as a child as we drove past. So different. Decayed, yet oddly beautiful among the meticulously upkept suburban residences which contrasted it in every direction. The house seemed to experience the world all on its own. As innovation brushed away the others of its kind, it alone remained. Stoically defiant. Refusing to give way.  At least, that's what I always thought as a young boy. It wasn't until much later that my dad would tell me a story about a dead family line and the bank's efforts to claim the property to no success. And so it sat dormant, waiting. For what, who's to say? But even as an adult I've always had a niggling feeling that old houses like that, the ones which refuse to go into that dark night of deconstruction, hold some sort of strange power. Ambiguous, but there all the same. As if somehow actively preventing their own demolition.   I finally decided to get inside and take a look. Having recently driven home to visit my parents, I cruised down that same street and was somewhat shocked to see that even after the years I'd been away, the house still remained. Now in an even more dilapidated state, its windows were still miraculously intact, caked in dust and grime to the point of opacity, but whole just the same. The entire property seemed to lean almost, having sloped in its own rot. That same childlike curiosity overtook me as the thought crossed my mind,  'Nobody's been inside for centuries...'  Obviously that wasn't true, but that's how it felt: there's always been an ancient presence to it. Something that doesn't quite want to let go.  I lay awake in my old room that night after having dinner with my parents and going to bed. All those forgotten feelings of naive adventure came rushing back and it didn't take much internal convincing to drag myself out there, quietly in the night, to that abandoned house.  I snuck around behind it, wary of being caught trespassing by the neighboring residents, and found that the back door had been completely removed. It was gone, not anywhere to be seen in the long grass and weeds or on the slimy wooden rear patio amongst the stray boards haphazardly cast aside around my feet.  'Who would steal an old door?'  The thought made me want to run, but I clicked on the flashlight and stepped inside anyway, covering my face in a bandana in the likely case of mold. I entered into the kitchen, completely barren besides some aged-brown bowls crusted with god knows what decayed food, if it was even food at all, resting atop the counter in a scattered formation. All the furniture was gone besides a smashed antique TV set in the living room. I pulled open the door, the sound of which will haunt my nightmares, and stepped into the foyer. The front entrance was blocked by stacks of yellowed newspapers and magazines taking up half of the already cramped area.   I mounted the stairs, and each gave a similar alarming creak as did the door. Ascending into the darkness, shining the light through the wooden banister, I saw three more doors: one down a short hallway to the right, one behind, the other was directly in front of me. Climbing the last few stairs and pushing open the nearest revealed a small bathroom, the upper corners of which were caked in thick black mold. I quickly tried to slam the door shut, frustrated to see that it refused to close again all the way in its state of disrepair. I'm not sure if it was right then that I truly began to realize just how stupid I was for being there, in a derelict old house way past midnight, or at some other point in the following minute, but the feeling inspired a deep, dread-filled nausea which made its home in my gut and refused to leave.  Backing away, spinning around and cringing at the sounds of the floorboards beneath, I opened the door now right ahead of me revealing a large bedroom, entirely bare except for a visibly soggy mattress tossed up against the far wall. An eerie moonlight showcased the roaming particles of dust and airborne dirt drifting across the space, disturbed by my presence. Now desperately wanting to leave, the fact took center stage in my mind that I really didn't belong there. My stomach began to sink and I started out through the door and towards the stairs. But there was one last room to see, and I couldn't just leave it at that.  The hallway was short, but it seemed to stretch into infinity in the beam of the flashlight. Every rickety step sent foreboding chills down my spine, instinct attempting to force me out, but I endeavored forward until I was gripping the handle, turning it, and pushing the door open. With a deafening squeak it slowly swung before hitting off the wall with a soft thud. Before I could step inside, a frantic scurrying enveloped the space, dragging swiftly across the floor in multiple directions. But it wasn't rats. It wasn't the paws or claws of cats or vermin. I heard the scraping hobble of bare human feet scatter through the darkness. Not just one set. Many. I was frozen in place, until a single raspy voice broke the silence.  ""Who are you?""   In that moment, staring into the pitch-black ahead, I wasn't even sure if the words had come from my own dry throat or from inside. After the longest time, I heard steps begin to slowly advance towards the doorway. I found my feet and stumbled backwards, breaking into a run and fleeing out the way I came in. Thankfully, I didn't hear anyone give chase behind me.  Climbing back through my still open bedroom window, I collapsed onto the bed, exhausted. After a while I must have fallen asleep because I awoke sometime just after dawn still fully clothed. New sunlight cast its warm glow over the top of me and I felt immediately relieved in the safety of a new day, thinking the whole thing very well could have just been some wild dream.  That's when I noticed him. Hulking. Haggard. Covered in dirt and hunched over by the door.  ""What were you doing in our house?""",scarystories,0,2023-06-14 07:11:24
41,The Doll Maker,14925ut,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/14925ut/the_doll_maker/,GrimmInDarkness,"In a little village, tucked away from the rest of the world lived Nils a doll maker. His home is up on a hill, completely isolated from everyone else.He creates dolls for those who have lost their friends, and loved ones. A empty husk without a soul.          There is a rumor that Nils once brought his wife to be  back to life.Since he had  dabbled in black magic, he broke the rules that was once taught to him by his master.When Nils brought her back to life she was no longer herself.She had harmed many people, and thus he had to end her life a second time. Not wanting his own apprentice to make the same mistake, he hid away the patchwork book in the drawer of his home.          When Nils apprentice took over for him since he was now retired. Nils warned Otto to never touch the patchwork book that lay tucked away in a locked drawer of his home. Since that book held dark magic Nils once used selfishly. He instructed Otto to only use the guidebook to create lifeless dolls, which held likeness to someone's deceased family member or friend.           ""It's nothing but bad luck."" Nils warned his apprentice, ""and it will bring nothing but tragedy,"" he added, settling down to rest.          Otto heeded his warning, only making dolls within reason and never bringing a person back to life.          That was until... the person he secretly loved was caught in an accident that took his life.   Without thinking he rushed to that small house on the hill where Nils lived. Otto opened the locked drawer, the one he was told not to take. A old patchwork book.          Opening it up the inside explained how to bring someone back to life. Though they would no longer be human, and would become a living doll. Along with their reincarnation would be grave consequences.          Pushing consequences aside, Otto got to work on bringing Kurt back to the living.          Gathering some of the materials was...difficult, but with a little persuasion he was able to acquire them.          Worried about his apprentice, Nils decided to check up on him. After all, the young man did just lose the person he cared about.          Opening the door to Otto's workshop he was not ready for what he was about to see. The scene before him was just like himself those years ago.        His apprentice gently touched Kurt's face affectionately, the person who was supposed to be dead. Who should have stayed dead.         Kurt's crimson eyes opened, and he looked around.          ""What have you done?!"" Nils panicked, backing up to go out the door. His blood ran cold.        Otto's emerald eyes were soon on him ""What have I done? Oh...only bringing my friend back to me, and wouldn't you know you're just in time for dinner. Isn't he Kurt?"".          Kurt's eyes were soon on the retired doll maker who was frozen in place. Why wasn't he turning on Otto? When he had brought back his wife in the past she had turned on him, and he had to end her...watching her die a second time.        ""It's time to eat""          The door to Otto's workshop closed, drowning out any screams that threatened to escape.          There lives a doll maker up on a hill isolated from the rest of the village who will make any doll you ask either it be a family member or a friend, he'll even bring them back to life.          Though there will be consequences, and as long as you follow the instructions you'll be just fine.          Just hope that you have plenty of flesh...",scarystories,2,2023-06-14 04:13:22

43,The Jones Family,148zasy,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148zasy/the_jones_family/,francisco32-0,"Once upon a time, in a quiet town nestled deep within the heart of a dense forest, there lived a seemingly ordinary family. The Joneses, as they were known, appeared to be an idyllic family to the outside world. However, a dark secret hid behind the closed doors of their quaint home.  Mr. Jones, a middle-aged man with an eerie smile, exuded an unsettling aura. He possessed a twisted mind, harboring a dark fascination for the macabre. Mrs. Jones, a timid woman worn down by years of emotional abuse, cowered beneath her husband's dominance. Their son, Peter, a frail and quiet boy, had unknowingly become a pawn in their twisted game.  Within the walls of their home, the Joneses indulged in acts that defied the boundaries of morality. They reveled in inflicting pain and suffering upon innocent beings, finding perverse pleasure in the screams of their victims. The family's basement was their sinister playground, a chamber of horrors that housed their most malevolent desires.  Late at night, they would venture into the forest, luring unsuspecting victims with their charm and false promises. The helpless prey, ensnared in their trap, were dragged back to the basement, where their worst nightmares would become reality.  The Joneses had perfected their methods over time, expertly dissecting their victims' bodies and savoring every gruesome moment. They reveled in the sight of blood, the sound of bones snapping, and the despair etched on their victims' faces. Each agonizing cry was a symphony to their twisted souls.  But as their vile acts continued, an ominous change loomed in the air. The once submissive Mrs. Jones began to question her role in the abhorrent rituals. The relentless torment inflicted upon her son sparked a flicker of maternal instinct buried deep within her tortured heart.  One fateful night, as Mr. Jones prepared to unleash his sadistic desires upon another unsuspecting soul, Mrs. Jones found her courage. She defied her husband's commands, releasing the terrified captive from their clutches and offering her protection.  Their rebellion triggered an avalanche of violence within the house. Mr. Jones, consumed by rage, turned his wrath upon his wife and son. The once obedient Peter fought back, fuelled by a mix of terror and an unwavering desire for survival.  A savage battle ensued, the walls stained with the blood of the oppressors and the oppressed. In the end, the Joneses lay lifeless, their reign of terror brought to a chilling halt. The house stood as a haunting monument to their malevolence, a testament to the depths of human depravity.  But the scars of their sinister legacy remained. Peter, forever marred by the horrors he witnessed and the monstrous acts he was forced to endure, struggled to find solace in a world forever tainted by darkness. The once innocent child had become a broken soul, haunted by nightmares that would never release their grip.  And so, the tale of the Joneses serves as a chilling reminder of the darkness that can reside within the human heart. It warns of the horrors that can be perpetrated behind closed doors, lurking just beyond the surface of everyday life. For in the depths of depravity, the most disturbing stories are born, forever etching their mark on the fragile tapestry of existence.",scarystories,0,2023-06-14 01:20:08
44,The Devil In The Closet,148xk8d,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148xk8d/the_devil_in_the_closet/,oOo_INFJ_oOo,"When my husband was 14 years old, he lived in an old four plex naval housing building that they had turned into apartments.  The building is still there today in Chula Vista, California. It was made of pure concrete, top to bottom.  There were six of these buildings spread across the block, and each building had four apartments, two on the bottom and two on the top.  He lived in the bottom south apartment with his mother and three sisters.  The apartment only had two bedrooms, and he was given his own room.    He spent a lot of time in his room, he felt like it was his place of solitude.  My husband was very meticulous about how his room was kept, everything had its own place, and he kept it very neat and clean.  When you walked into the bedroom, the bed was on the back right hand side of the room, one window on the back wall and another on the right side wall next to his bed. He had a small tv on an old tv cart which was on the left as you entered the room.  There was a six foot wide closet located on the wall to the left as you enter into the room.   The closet doors opened outwards and inside was his dresser.  The dresser was white and about five foot wide and four foot tall.  On the top of the dresser he had his cross, Bible, a picture of a guardian Angel and two kids walking across a bridge, incense, and a Virgin of Guadalupe candle which was in the center of the dresser.  All the clothes were neatly folded and in the dresser, nothing was hanging.  One night, roughly about 8pm, he lit his Virgin of Guadalupe candle, something he liked to do on occasion. He left his room to go talk to his mom and grab something to eat.  About a half hour later, he went back to his room.  The windows were closed and the curtains were drawn.  The only light in the room was emanating from the candle.  He noticed out of the corner of his eye that the flames were bouncing back and forth, usually how a flame reacts if there is wind blowing it.  The light from the candle was casting a large shadow against the back wall inside the closet.  As he moved closer,  he noticed the flame was in the shape of a devil.  It had prominent flames for eyes and flaming horns on the top of its head.  Its sinister face was expressing pure hatred and extreme rage and as soon as it sensed fear in my husband, its facial expression slowly started to morph into the most evil and terrifying smile.  It smiled because it knew he was scared.. and it loved it.. My husband became frozen in fear.  He stood there facing the closet and he thought to himself ""I need to call my mom"" and he whispered ""mom"". .. It was too quiet for her to hear..  He called out to her again..  ""mom"" just a little louder than the last time.. still too quiet.. he called louder.. ""MOM"".  She finally came into the room mad, yelling ""what!!"" and he replied in a whisper ""Look at the wall.."" She replied ""WHAT!!"".  He whispered out of the side of his mouth, still frozen in fear, ""Look.. at..the..wall..""She turned her head towards the closet and looked and that's when she saw the demonic smile of the devil smiling back at them inside the flame.  She yelled ""Get that thing out of my house!!!"".  Without hesitation, he grabbed it, blew it out, and ran and threw it in the dumpster.    I wrote this for my husband because he wanted to tell people about his experience.",scarystories,0,2023-06-13 23:42:28

I've had an inordinate amount of therapists and doctors. Been in and out of psychiatric facilities. Prescribed this medication and that medication. Nothing works.   When I was young, it was cute. Children often have imaginary friends. But the older I got the less cute it was. The more my mother seemed to be disappointed in me. ""Nobody likes a liar, Stevie."", she always used to say. Like I was making things up for the fun of it. ""Ghosts aren't real."", my dad would say, shaking his head.   My medical providers have been just as unhappy with me. I've been prescribed more medications than I can count or even remember. ""Take this, you will feel better."" ""Give it time to build up in your system. It doesn't work right away."" ""You can't get better if you don't take your medication."" I've heard it all.   But I did take the pills. They don't work. I can still see them in the periphery of my eyesight. Lurking around at the edge of my vision. The shadows. They follow me everywhere. It never stops. I can hardly stand it. I don't know what they want.   When I was in the facility, at medication time, I got pulled aside. Every time. To make sure I wasn't cheeking my pills. They were convinced I'd found some ingenious method of refusing to take my meds. But I would swallow them. Every. Time. Dr. Morris used to say, ""I can't help you if you won't let me, Steve."" ""Yes, Dr. Morris."", I'd reply. ""You want to get better, don't you?"" ""Yes, Dr. Morris.""  But I didn't get better. They won't go away. So I've decided to do it. I've smuggled away a spoon from the cafeteria. A pair of safety scissors from craft time. The pills don't work. So I have to take out my eyes. It was easy to get them to pop out of their sockets. But I wasn't expecting it to be so hard. The nerve ending and connective tissues are still attached. And safety scissors aren't very sharp.   There. It's done.   Oh my god...  I can still see them!",scarystories,2,2023-06-13 23:30:00
46,When Day Breaks,148vgab,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148vgab/when_day_breaks/,Divine1nstincts,"As we arrive at the affected area, we notice the devastating effects of SCP-001. The sun's rays have transformed people into amorphous, flesh-like entities, and they continue to propagate the infection. Our primary objective is to rescue survivors and escort them to designated safe zones where they can receive appropriate containment and medical care.  We equip ourselves with specialized hazmat suits, capable of providing protection against the sunlight and the infectious effects of the anomaly. Our communication devices allow us to coordinate with our team and gather information about survivors in need of assistance.  We move cautiously through the streets, searching for survivors while being mindful of any potential threats. Our training and experience help us navigate the chaos, identify safe routes, and utilize containment protocols to neutralize any infected individuals we encounter.  Our primary concern is to offer reassurance and support to the survivors we come across. We provide them with guidance on how to avoid direct sunlight, reassure them that we are here to help, and lead them towards safety. We also provide basic medical aid and monitor their condition to ensure they don't show signs of infection.  Together, we work efficiently and effectively, ensuring the safety of as many civilians as possible. Our dedication to the MTF's mission drives us forward, even in the face of this daunting and dangerous SCP-001 outbreak.  Startled by the yelp coming from the old war bunker, we exchange a quick glance, confirming our shared concern. We immediately move towards the sound, cautiously approaching the entrance of the bunker. With our flashlights casting beams of light into the darkness, we call out, announcing our presence and offering assistance to whoever may be inside.  As we inch closer, our ears strained for any response, we hear a weak voice, pleading for help. It's coming from deep within the bunker. We exchange a nod, silently agreeing on the course of action.  With utmost caution, we descend into the bunker, keeping our guard up and flashlights sweeping the surroundings. The atmosphere inside is tense, filled with a combination of musty air and echoes of the past.  Soon, we locate the source of the distress call‚Äîa wounded survivor, trapped under debris, struggling to free themselves. Working together, we carefully clear the rubble, ensuring not to trigger any further collapses.  Once the survivor is freed, we assess their condition, offering words of comfort and reassurance. We quickly administer basic medical aid, tending to their injuries as best we can given the circumstances.  As we treat their wounds, we engage in conversation, attempting to gather information about other survivors in the area and any potential dangers we should be aware of. Their fear and confusion are understandable, and we strive to provide support, explaining our role as MTF personnel and the steps we're taking to contain the SCP-001 outbreak.  After ensuring the survivor is stable, we assist them in navigating the bunker and guide them towards the designated safe zone. Throughout the process, we maintain open communication with our team, updating them on our progress and the discovery of the survivor.  Our duty is to safeguard as many lives as possible, and with this newfound survivor under our protection, we push forward, ready to face the challenges that lie ahead.   As our team regroups, we communicate with them through our radios, sharing the information about the survivor we found and their account of others in the vicinity. The team acknowledges the update and informs us that they have also discovered a few survivors scattered across different locations.  With a sense of urgency, we decide to split up to maximize our effectiveness in locating and aiding the remaining survivors. Our shared objective is to ensure their safety and guide them to the designated safe zones.  As we carefully make our way down the streets, our attention is suddenly drawn to a disturbing sight‚Äîan instance of SCP-001, an abomination composed of melted candle wax-like substance with numerous eyes. We pause, assessing the situation, aware of the immediate danger it poses.  Taking note of your remark about the flammability of the creature due to the oils in our skin, I swiftly retrieve a road flare from my equipment. Igniting the flare, I throw it with precision at the SCP-001 instance. The flare makes contact, causing the creature to erupt in flames, its horrifying form consumed by fire.  We maintain a safe distance, observing the result of our action, ensuring that the threat has been neutralized. The flames burn brightly, reducing the SCP-001 instance to ashes. With this immediate danger dealt with, we continue our search for the remaining survivors, mindful of potential encounters with other anomalies.  As we progress through the streets, we rely on our training and expertise to identify any signs of survivors and maintain constant communication with the team. Our priority remains the well-being and protection of those affected by the SCP-001 outbreak.   After weeks of tireless search and rescue operations, spanning across Montana and Maine, we finally conclude our efforts, having successfully located and aided all the survivors in those areas. It has been a challenging and emotionally demanding task, but our determination and dedication have paid off.  Regrouping in Michigan, we take a moment to rest and gather our thoughts. The weight of our experiences and the gravity of the SCP-001 outbreak weigh heavily on us. As we discuss the progress made and the lives we were able to save, a sense of satisfaction mixed with lingering concern fills the air.  Knowing that the SCP-001 instances will eventually die on their own, we decide to head back towards Site-19, the secure facility of the SCP Foundation. It's a temporary respite, a chance to regroup, debrief, and prepare for future containment and research efforts.  During our journey back, we maintain communication with the command center at Site-19, updating them on our successful search and rescue mission and the overall situation on the ground. Our collective knowledge and experiences gathered from the field will contribute to the ongoing understanding and containment of SCP-001.  Once we arrive at Site-19, we undergo a debriefing session, sharing valuable information and insights with our superiors and fellow MTF members. We provide detailed reports on the outbreak, the behavior of the SCP-001 instances, and any anomalies we encountered along the way.  While we await the eventual demise of the SCP-001 instances, we remain vigilant and ready to respond to any unforeseen developments or emerging anomalies. Our duty as MTF personnel extends beyond the initial crisis, encompassing ongoing containment, research, and protection of the general public.

She loved Marvel movies, especially Spider-Man, cooking, and swimming. She was such a fast swimmer. When we went to the lake, I would pretend to chase after her and she would swim away, screaming and laughing. I never saw her laugh again. She became depressed after she lost her mother. A mural had popped up against her window, blocking it entirely up. I loved how she was so caring for others around her, especially her mother. Her mother was the sweetest person I ever met. An older version of the girl I once fell in love with. She was in my history class, ancient history. She loved learning about the ancient events, science too. She believed in the the science about the world starting, as well as the universe. Her favourite was physics. I wish she had loved me as much as I had loved her. When she saw me in her window she should've said hi, not screamed. That's absurd.

It really hadn't been his fault, after all. The Alliance were responsible for the numerous failed hybrid nurseries. They never ceased attempting the fusion of an intellectually superior yet physically brawn species that would rule not only the area the Terrestrials referred to as ""The Milky Way"" but almost the entire quadrant of Stygian.  ""Ozymandius, it has to be seen by the Vanguard first. Everything is screened by the Vanguard before it goes before the Alliance and its been that way for what would be considered 5 years in Terra time"", Kleeta meant well. She really did. She knew the failure of Ozymandius' regime was hard on everyone but him, more so than anyone.   Through trials and tribulations, the planet of Atramentous had known several different leaders. Ozymandius wasn't the only failure in their executive history. When the entire future of your whole civilization and advancement of your species is predicated on the successful amalgam of your own kind and Terrestrials?

Granted, Lugosimmo Belammina were first generation and still thought to be the best solution to strengthening the Terrestrials' bond to Atramentarians. It was so promising. How it all went awry? No one even knew. They just knew it did. Kleeta, the 2 aberrations and the other failed Belammina were a constant reminder to not just himself, but all of Atramentous. Since Atramentous began studying Terrestrials? They learned humans are very superstitious beings. They fear what they don't know. They worship deities and have actual structures where this takes place. Ozymandius recalled the term being ""church"". How odd to actually build an entire construction just to praise your higher power. These Terrestrials were a strange lot. As they worshipped their deities? They feared their monsters. From what Atramentarian society tells us? No monster was feared more so than a vampire. They were even more powerful than the Terrestrials that feared them. They were alluring, charismatic and enticing. All things Atramentarians wanted to but would never be to humans. The Vanguard of his day approved the Belammina trials and they proceeded without hesitation. What no one could've foreseen? Lugosimmo Belammina were just too flagitious. Nothing could neutralize their brutality. They tried infusions of Oxytocin (the mother/baby bonding hormone) but the Belammina just bonded with their human mothers, attacked as soon as the mother showed any affection and ripped their throats out down to their spinal cord. Obviously? This was not ideal for Atramentarian/Terrestrial hybrids. They needed the advancement of their species, not the irradication of their human mothers that bore them. Oh, the sleepless nights Ozymandius had deliberating on the fate of the Belammina. But, the betrayal came swift and with retribution. The Alliance, despite approving the trials and supporting his decision, put the sole blame of this failed hybrid unification on his shoulders. He was immediately overthrown and imprisoned for a short time while the Alliance regrouped and appointed a new Vanguard.  The next step? The Alliance commissioned the creation of Venerate. He was to show no aggression, mate with a human and propagate their species but to an elevated form. His 1st contact went well. His 2nd and 3rd contacts went even better. Insemination had taken place. The 2 aberrations confirmed that. How long was the gestation period for a female Terrestrial? Wasn't it 36 - 40 Terra weeks? Ozymandius seems to recall that stat from one of his many research sessions looking into their genetics. How this would combine with Atramentarians' DNA? We were all soon to find out. Ozymandius' only concern was that it DID combine. Surely with Venerate's docile disposition? The aggressive nature of the Lugosimmo Belammina will be an unpleasant thing of the past. This time? It had to be right. They needed this to work. Stagnation of the species was not an option.  ""Kleeta, I don't tell you enough, but I do appreciate you. You've been the one constant since the rise and fall of my empire. I really don't know what I'd do without you."" Ozymandius looked at her. He remembered seeing Belammina for the first time. Pale, ghastly, evil looking things, he'd thought to himself, but they were a necessary evil for Atramentarian society. Attractive was not a word he'd ever use to describe their kind. However, there was a kindness in Kleeta's eyes, black as they may be, that he'd never seen in the other Belammina and certainly not in the 2 aberrations. She had a maternal and nurturing manner he hadn't realized he desired until she provided it to him. Given his Atramentarian genetics and her Belammina ones? A fruitful union would never be encouraged. Kleeta was the Scarlett O'Hara to his Ashley Wilkes. She could desire but never be with Ozymandius. It just could never be.  ""I'd always known you were grateful, but hearing you express it is very gratifying to me, as well."" Kleeta smiled. If those obsidian eyes could have shone? They would have. It really did mean a lot to finally get the recognition she'd desired for so long. If just recognition from Ozymandius was the only thing she could achieve after all of her devotion? She'd take it. He'd changed so much from when he first attained power. He was unbearable then. Ozymandius, King of Kings, the Alliance built all of the Atramentarian backbone and foundation on the key principle of genetic advancement via Belammina being the future for all of Atramentarian kind. There could be no other way. She understood how the weight of such a burden was torturous. Heavy is the head that wears the crown and all that. Why he had to be, what was it some of the Terrestrials called it? Oh, yes, such a DICK about it was beyond her comprehension. She believed in him when everyone else did. She still believed when everyone else did not. Kleeta was there in the beginning. Kleeta was there during the coup d'√©¬∑tat. Kleeta is here for the birth of the second (and? Hopefully, last) generation Atramentarians. She has earned her spot in the Winner's Circle alongside Ozymandius.  ""What now, Ozymandius? Do we bring the human female to Atramentous? Are they going to be born on Terra? Contingency for this has to be new. This is setting a precedent in Atramentarian history."" Kleeta could feel herself fill with the hope of days gone by. If only Ozymandius could reinvent himself and become relevant to the Vanguard then, by association, he would also hold clout with the Alliance once again. ""It has to work, Kleeta. It simply has to work."" Ozymandius was more hopeful than since his ascension to power. It all hinged on the female Terrestrial now...     Waking up, butt ass naked as the day she was born, somewhere unknown to her was a weekly thing to Allie. She'd get up, straighten herself out, to the best of her ability, and take her walk of shame on out the door. These weren't foreign concepts to her. What was a foreign concept? Being so hungry that you could eat a moose. She couldn't remember the last time she was this starved. Maybe the Blue Bayou has a decent breakfast special because she wanted to eat more than she'd ever wanted to eat in her life. Even crazier? She was normally content to eat some oatmeal and toast. She really didn't want or need that much. Today? She wanted meat and a lot of it. Well, more meat than she'd gotten last night, anyway. Ham, beef, chicken, fish, she didn't care. It didn't have to be cooked too long, either.   She cleaned herself up to the best of her ability. What happened last night? The bar? Good looking guy? Fish head. Fish head? No, not a fish head. It couldn't be. Must've been a fever dream, spiked drink? Not sure, but last night was all one big blur.   She stopped dead in her tracks. The abdominal pain was unbearable. She was doubling over. What is going on? Given her track record? Getting regular antibiotic prescriptions for ""The gift that keeps on giving"" (insert STI of your choice) was common enough. Although, the next day was pretty early for symptoms to start. She knew something was going on. What could it be? Her stomach growled, in protest, to her not getting to the Blue Bayou quick enough. Why was she so damned hungry?  It was right after they opened that morning. No one was in the parking lot. The waitress was wiping down the counter. Allie was the only customer. She sat on a stool and looked at the menu the waitress handed her. The waitress, Tiffany Poole, looked at Allie in sheer disgust. Could have something to do with screwing her baby daddy, Cletus, last month. Perhaps not. You could never be sure.  ""I want steak and eggs, rare steak and eggs overeasy"" Allie flatly stated. ""Overeasy. Something you're very familiar with."" Tiffany cattily sneered. Allie didn't care. She was hungry. She was in pain. She wanted to eat, go home and crash, and get to sleep before Don's ass got home from work. That was the last thing she needed today. The steak was bloody and the eggs were runny. Now, just because Allie was the town whore? That didn't mean she hadn't any table manners. Normally? She could be pretty impressive with how she holds herself at the dinner table. In her younger days? She was asked out a lot and taken to some pretty fancy dinners so she learned basic etiquette by trial and error. She never bothered listening to Mom and Tish when she was younger. She kinda regretted that now. They really did try to teach her but she just would not listen. It's too late to worry about any of that now.  Allie looked down at the egg yolk running into and mixing with the bloody steak juice pooling at the sides of her plate. Any other day? She'd have gotten sick at the looks of this. Why did it look like the best thing she'd ever gotten? She looked at the fork in her right hand and her steak knife in her left. She set them down at the sides of the plate. She picked up the steak, grabbed an empty glass and proceeded to wring out the steak and watch the bloody juice drip into it. Not that Allie cared, but Tiffany, Bo, the busboy, and the cook/owner, R√©my, were all staring at her, mouths agape. She set the steak down and swallowed a big drink of bloody juice. She rolled the steak and began dipping it into the runny egg yolk. She then placed one end of the steak in her mouth and began tearing it off. She was sucking and chewing in the process. ""Sad part is? That's not even the most meat she's had in her mouth at once."" Bo matter-of-factly stated to R√©my and Tiffany as they proceed to burst out laughing.  Venerate had accomplished what Ozymandius and the Vanguard & Alliance couldn't before. This Terrian female isn't the highest quality human, but? Lugosimmo Belammina kind of need a mother that can handle being pregnant with vampiric aliens.   This was crunch time. All of the planning, research, sacrifice, etc.? Would it turn out the way they predicted? Would it turn out an abysmal failure? So much was riding on this.  Don got home and stripped off his uniform and hit the shower. What a day. Un-fucking-believable. Never in his 20 years on the force had he seen anything as horrific as that.   ""Allie? Allie?! You home?"" Don softly asked as he walked into their shared bedroom. It was a filthy mess since Allie felt more like screwing every dude in Eerie than she did keeping house. Once, just one time, he wanted to come home and see her trifiling ass in bed where she belongs.  He slid into bed and got adjusted. Just as he was dozing off? Allie walked into the front door of their house. Don thought, ""Fuck her. I don't have the energy for this shit right now."" She pushed the bedroom door open. Don looked up and out from the dark bedroom and into the lit hallway. What the actual fuck?!?!  It was indeed Allie. What Don couldn't figure out? WTF was wrong with her stomach? It looked like a beach ball in there.  ""JESUS FUCKIN' CHRIST, ALLIE! WHAT THE HELL!"" Don yelled.  ""It hurts, Donnie. It hurts so bad. I..."" Allie trailed off.  Then? It happened. Don heard a God awful tearing and Allie wailed like a Banshee. The front of her tight white shirt turned crimson red in the abdominal area. Something was moving. Something was slithering its way from under Allie's shirt. Don still heard screaming. Two people screaming. He was screaming, too.  Allie fell backwards and Nestea plunged herself onto the hallway floor. She'd ceased crying by this point. She was dead.  The youngling crawled away from it's Terrain mother. It was too small to find any footing. The youngling proceeded to crawl towards Don as he stood in complete shock and abject horror. He crawled up Don's pants, shirt and looked him dead in Don's widely dilated pupils.   ""Father?!"" The youngling hissed and smiled diabolically. It's pitch black eyes and razor sharp teeth were the last thing Don Hoff saw when the youngling commenced feeding.

50,The Windows to the Soul: Allie's Assimilation,148sf6z,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148sf6z/the_windows_to_the_soul_allies_assimilation/,Thick_Mick_Chick,"*Note* This is part 2 to Shiloh's Final Battle   Gomez and Tish pulled into their driveway and heard barking. They'd gotten a German Shepherd pup when Guillermo Del Toro's ""The Strain"" was on T.V. As a joke, but also because they loved the character? They named him Thomas Eichhorst after the Nazi vampire who was one of Guillermo Del Toro's most powerful villains ever created. No one put much thought into the name choice considering they loved all things horror.  ""What the hell has Eichhorst going off? He knows it's us!"" Gomez couldn't understand why he'd bark at the 2 people he NEVER barks at.  ""I can honestly say I'm not even surprised after this day."" Tish exhaled and proceeded to get out of the car. Eichhorst continued the call of his people. ""IKE! EICHHORST! KNOCK IT THE HELL OFF!"" Gomez yelled so Eichhorst could hear because he was behind the chain link fence in the backyard. He acted like he didn't hear a word.  As they got closer to the house? They noticed Eichhorst was not barking at them. He was barking at the woods BEHIND them. ""He sees something we don't."" Tish matter-of-factly stated. She & Gomez simultaneously turned to look into the woods. Nothing. No noise. Nothing was there. Eichhorst stopped barking as soon as they turned towards the woods. Everything stopped. ""What the hell is going on, Cara Mia?"" Gomez was starting to experience what Tish had all day long.  ""I don't know, Mon Cher. I just know I don't like it."" Tish continued glancing into the trees.  ""Probably time to sit back and relax. You've had a bad day that ended a rough week. It's time to just chill."" As if knowing what Gomez had just said? His city issued phone started ringing.  ""NO. ABSOLUTELY not! I'm off tonight! What is so critical that Gomer & Goober can't handle it?"" Gomez could feel his blood pressure start to rise. ""Find out what it is 1st, Craig, before you go into a meltdown."" Tish always called him Craig when she was irritated. ""Hello?!"" Gomez did a poor job hiding his inconvenience.  ""Man, it's Ol Shiloh! You gotta get over here, Gomez. It's bad! It's so bad!"" Bubba was inconsolable. He was on the verge of tears. ""Whoa, slow down, Bubba. What happened?"" Gomez tried bringing levity. ""We came by to check on him when we were on patrol. He was in the doorway, he was..."" Bubba finally started crying. He hated it. The last thing he wanted to do was cry in front of his co-workers. He just simply could not process what the hell they'd rolled up on.  ""Wait? Ol Shiloh is hurt?"" Gomez was trying to process what Bubba was saying. Tish's brow furrowed. She didn't like what she was hearing.  ""I mean, if you consider hurt dead with his fuckin' throat ripped out to his spinal cord? Then? Yeah, he's hurt."" Bubba's anger at his own insecurities was boiling over onto Gomez. ""Look, Bubba. Clearly you guys have been going through something over there. I'm headed that way. For future reference? Don't take your shit out on me. I didn't do anything to you."" Gomez scolded. ""Sorry, Gomez. It's just so..."" and Bubba broke down further. Gomez hopped back into the car. ""What's going on? Who was that? Don? Bubba?"" Tish was concerned.  ""Hop in the passenger's side if you want to find out. I have to go."" Gomez started the engine. Tish walked around and got in.  They pulled into Shiloh's driveway behind the Eerie, Indiana patrol car. Bubba came running out to greet them.  ""Don is in there with him. The paramedics just got here a few minutes ago."" Bubba proceeded to catch Gomez up. He and Tish had been so busy looking at Bubba and the patrol car they didn't notice the bus parked to the side of the house ready to pick up Ol Shiloh.   Tish & Gomez entered the threshold where Ol Shiloh laid on his back, staring at the ceiling. His throat. Jesus, his throat. It was gone. They both were rocking back on their heels.  ""We thought it was a big cat attack. It's not. Those bite marks on his throat? That's human not feline."" Kennedy was an intelligent little bastard. Arrogant, condescending and holier-than-thou, but very intelligent. Not only would he inform all of the insubordinates around him about everything they didn't know? He'd do it with one hell of a cocky attitude. Ah, Kennedy, and his unsolicited lessons. Time to sit up and listen in class. ..  ""When he opened the door? We thought it was an animal attack. Instead? He must've been attacked by humans. The bite marks definitely indicate human but the vicious nature of how deep the wounds went indicate something much more powerful. This was to his spinal cord."" Kennedy didn't look like he knew-it-all. He looked perplexed.  ""But how could a human bite that deep?"" Gomez asked.  ""I don't know. I honestly don't know."" Kennedy was lost for the 1st time since becoming a paramedic 7 years ago. He'd never seen trauma of this caliber. He hadn't even seen this level of brutality and he'd rolled up on gang fights.   Don and Bubba were both on the front porch, looking in, mouths agape. Gomer & Goober indeed.  Kennedy loaded up Ol Shiloh's body with the assistance of a new EMT that Gomez was fairly certain Kennedy was banging. I mean, he was a total Chad so why wouldn't he?  Don put the camera away in the trunk of the patrol car. At least he had the presence of mind to get the pictures taken before emergency services hit the scene. This was going to rock Eerie, Indiana's foundation. Murder hadn't happened here in anyone's lifetime so this was a ""big city"" problem they weren't use to dealing with. Nosey people, scared kids, idiot media, this was not what Eerie needed right now. It certainly wasn't what he needed. He had enough of Allie putting out for anyone that would buy her a 6 pack or some cigarettes. Had he known he could've gotten off so cheaply? He sure as hell wouldn't have married her. Unfortunately, for his dumb ass? He actually fell in love with her. Why? He didn't know. Self esteem was never his strong suit. So? After dating 6 months, her only cheating 3 times, then getting pregnant with his baby? He made the perilous decision to try to make an honest woman out of her. Don sincerely doubted if Allie had ever been honest about anything in her life. Coincidentally? When they came back from their Honeymoon 2 weeks later? She'd miscarried. Well, she claimed she miscarried. Don never saw a pregnancy test nor would he have been üíØ% sure the baby was his. He would've actually suspected the baby was not. Looking at all of it now, how did he not see it sooner?  ""Get to those pics, ASAP Rocky, Don!"" Gomez instructed.  ""Please, don't be an embarrassing Gen Xer who thinks he's so cool and up to date on all of the current lingo. They laugh at us only a little less than Boomers."" Tish was still trying to get a handle on all of this and his Goofy antics weren't really in need right now.  The woods to the side of Ol Shiloh's place was the same as the woods to the back of Gomez & Tish's driveway. Eichhorst couldn't understand why his humans didn't acknowledge his bark. He never barked. He especially never barked at his humans. Why did they think he had? Didn't they see the kids in the woods? The little boy? The little girl? How could they not? As far away as the kids were? They smelled funny. He didn't understand. It was the same smell in the air that he sensed right before thunderstorms began and he hid under Gomez and Tish's bed. Humans don't smell like that. It's impossible to explain ozone to a German Shepherd.   The children watched as Ol Shiloh was loaded onto the ambulance and taken away. The couple were getting into their car and the deputies were already headed down the driveway.  ""It has began."" The dark-haired pale little girl spoke. ""Indeed. It has. Let's see what Venerate has in store for the humans now."" The boy replied and they headed towards town.  Eerie, Indiana was like any other Midwest, small town. You had your good ol boys & jerks. You had freaks and geeks. You had Bible thumpers and always humpers. Allie Hoff was the ""always humpers"" category. No one nor nothing could change that. The girl went through life bartering sex and blow jobs for anything she needed. It was a pitiful existence and she knew it. Unfortunately? She never learned and didn't know another way.  With Eerie being so small? She was limited to the same ""favor givers"" over and over, again. Never any new blood. Never any fresh meat. It really stifled what few prospects she had. She looked up from where she was slumped over the bar, in her barstool, nursing a bottle of beer. She happened to look up to the front door. Who was that? She'd never seen him in here before. He was about 6'3"" with dark wavy hair and ocean blue eyes. His skin was sun kissed and the muscles showcased the entire package. Wait. WTF? This dude doesn't belong here. Who the hell is he?  He appeared to glide and almost float towards her. He gestured to the empty bar stool next to her. ""Is this seat taken?"" He smiled with almost glowing white teeth. She locked up. Wait? He wants to sit next to me?   She just shook her head no because she was too shocked to speak.  ""Hi, I'm Vinny."" He extended his hand and his gleaming smile never faltered.  ""Allie."" She finally squeaked out. Guys like this didn't talk to girls like her.  ""Nice to meet you, Allie."" Vinny swung around and attempted to get the bartender's attention.  ""I'll have a Jack & Coke. For the lady?"" Vinny slyly smiled at Allie and she was entranced.  ""Same"" was all Allie could say.  He paid for their drinks and handed Allie hers. ""I've never seen you before."" Allie just finally came out with it.  ""No, I'm new to the area. You wouldn't have seen me around here."" Vinny replied. ""Oh? New from where?"" Allie was trying to proceed with caution. She did not want to miss out on the opportunity that was this gorgeous specimen of a man.  ""You've never heard of it, trust me. No one ever has."" Vinny still held his smile. ""I'd still like to know."" Allie returned a smile that was nowhere near as beautiful as Vinny's.  ""Maybe when we get to know each other better."" Vinny conceded. ""Oh? So we're going to be getting to know each other better, are we?"" Allie coyly pressed. ""If I have any say in it? Most definitely."" Vinny winked. Damn. That boy was so fine she'd drink his bathwater if he peed in it. He was the perfect vision of the perfect man. It was as if he were tailor made just for Allie. How, though? How could she actually meet her real life Manic Pixie Dream boy? The one she'd dreamed about when she was a little girl. The one who laughed at everything she said. Listened attentively. The one who only had eyes for her no matter how many ""rich bitch"" girls were around. She'd treat him like a postage stamp. She'd lick every square inch of him and go back for 2nds on the important parts. ""Allie, you strike me as a very straightforward girl."" Vinny snapped her out of her daze. ""I am. No bullshit."" Allie replied. ""Then? Allow me to be straightforward by telling you that I want to fuck you senseless."" Vinny casually stated as if someone asked him for the time. ""Well, that is certainly straightforward."" Allie was stunned. She wasn't so stunned that she'd let an opportunity like this pass her by. She'd made up her mind that was going to happen as soon as she saw him. ""And your answer?"" Vinny inquired.  ""Anywhere. Any place. Any time Any day."" Allie assured. With that? They stood from their barstools and headed outside. He even smelled good but not a typical smell. It was like the air at the beginning of a thunderstorm. He smelled like ozone. Ozone??? Was that even possible?  Gomez and Tish got home and plopped on the couch. Eichhorst came through the doggy door and trotted straight to Tish. ""I've got leftovers, Piggy. Give me a sec."" Tish opened her container from the restaurant. Eichhorst sat patiently waiting for his command.  ""What a fuckin' day."" Gomez exhaled exhaustedly.  ""Yeah. It has been. Poor Ol Shiloh. This is just too much."" Tish's head continued to try to find rationality where there was one. ""I'm getting in the shower and going to bed. You need anything?"" Gomez slowly rose up from the couch, joints popping like a glow stick. ""No. I'm probably gonna watch a movie and go to bed after."" Tish answered. ""Horror?"" Gomez queried.  ""What else?"" Tish smiled albeit a tired one. Eichhorst jumped up next to her on the couch and laid on her like a lap dog.  Vinny was walking Allie into their local little flop hotel room. It wasn't like she wasn't familiar with the place. The staff referred to her as ""Frequent flier"". She didn't particularly like the insensitive moniker but couldn't deny its accuracy, either. He closed the door behind them in one failed swoop. This was a practiced talent she noticed. Didn't matter. He was hers tonight.  ""Make yourself comfortable."" Vinny gestured to the only bed in the room. Allie took a seat. She looked up at him and noticed the ozone smell becoming stronger. Weird. He smelled good but she had never known someone to smell like a thunderstorm.  ""I'm going to step into the bathroom for just a minute. I'll be right out."" Vinny stepped into their adjacent bathroom. She heard loud music and laughter from somewhere down the hall but couldn't quite place where. It was for the best. Allie had always been, well, vocal. Normally? If a guy is hitting it right? She hit the vocal range of 2 stray cats screwing. She couldn't help it. She was like this every since puberty. It was all the girl thought about. She figured she was probably a nympho although she was never officially diagnosed. She couldn't hear what he was doing. It didn't matter. It wasn't going to affect her and what she was doing. She walked to the curtains and made sure they were completely closed. Although they were, why did she feel like she was being watched? She stripped down with the efficiency of a HazMat worker decontaminating. She heard the bathroom door opening. She kept her back turned so she could make the surprise last as long as possible. Was this the night? The night she could finally reach sexual satisfaction? Was this the dick that was going to change her life? There was a soft green glow coming from the bathroom. Must be a nightlight? She hadn't noticed before. Was it getting brighter? It looked like it was coming towards her. Was it Vinny? Maybe he's videoing me? Not like I'd care, but he could have asked. ""Are you recording me?"" She asked as she continued to look towards the window. His breathing was different. It seemed labored and, well, wet. It didn't sound like he did earlier, that was for sure. ""You okay?"" Allie asked. His breathing was raspier, louder, wetter. She decided to bail on her romantic idea of not turning around before he reached her. She turned around and her playful nature and smile fell away immediately.   Her brain couldn't process what her eyes were seeing. It couldn't be real. God knows along with banging any guy she could get her hands on, she used to hit hard drugs back in the day. This had to be a flashback. It had to be a ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" scenario. This? This ""Mars Attacks!"" bullshit right here? This is not reality.  It's bulbous head was transparent. It looked like a barrel eye fish that she saw on a nature show she used to blaze and chill to. That also explained the soft green glow. It sounded like and looked aquatic. That's where the wet sounds were coming from. It kept advancing. It had a white upper torso with arms and webbed fingers on each hand. What sent her over the edge? From the waist down? It was a human male. All the important parts and in working condition. How? She had no idea. But? When she meant working condition? It was working it's way right towards her. Wait, this thing is going to still have sex with me?! No. Absolutely not.  ""No. Stop."" Allie feebly tried to resist. It did no good. Allie didn't know she was the reason he was even here. This was the whole gameplan all along. It was never a casual hook up.   Venerate had studied numerous different civilizations but Terrestrials always fascinated him. They were so primitive but also entertaining. The Alliance had tried many different hybrid trials between themselves and Terrestrials. They never made it out of infancy. There was a weakness that need strengthened in their own DNA to combine with humans. They worked on it until their resolution was Venerate himself. He has the best of what their kind has to offer with the malleable adaptivity to change himself into anything he needs to to be able to convince Terrestrials to trust him. It worked. Ol Shiloh thought Venerate was his deceased wife. Allie thought he was her dream man. He needs a human to impregnate. Beggars can't be choosers. It worked out perfectly. Allie took one look at his bulbous transparent head, his lower nontransparent stiff head and proceeded to pass out on the bed. It didn't matter. Venerate didn't need her awake to begin their hybrid breeding program. And? Begin the program he did. Everything was coming to fruition via the Alliance's vision. All of their hard work finally got them here. The pale, dark-haired children stood outside the hotel room window, peaking through the crack in the curtain. They were able to relay the mission a success with Venerate making first, second and third contact. Once the younglings come forth? The Alliance can begin occupation and what a glorious day that will truly be! Everything was going so perfectly. This just had to be fool proof. They walked off into the night, smiling so much those obsidian eyes even looked less demonic. This was the beginning of prosperity. This was the beginning of the end of humanity.

She'd practically begged the clock to go faster at work this afternoon, knowing full well she had the weekend off. Being a police dispatcher? You needed those ""mental health breaks"" that so many sing virtues about. It'd been a rough mental health week, for sure.  Tish recognized the number on the caller I.D. lt was Ol Shiloh. He'd been a paratrooper in Vietnam, and he came back stateside without so much of a scratch on him physically. Mentally? He saw ""gooks"" (Ol Shiloh's completely politically incorrect term for the Viet Cong as well as the eponymous Charlie) at the bottom of the basement stairs and in the shower waiting for him to enter the bathroom. As a little girl, Tish knew Ol Shiloh had a good heart but a feeble mind. His visual and auditory hallucinations made him the laughing stock of many of Eerie's child residents who pointed, snickered, and rolled their finger at the side of their temple, indicating he was crazier than a shithouse rat. Ol Shiloh sounded legitimately scared when he called, though. This was not an emotion Tish was familiar with. Nothing rattled Ol Shiloh even with his advanced case of post-traumatic stress disorder. He'd known Tish's parents, and? Oddities aside? Ol Shiloh was a good man. So? Speaking to him had never presented a challenge until today, and, Oh, what a challenge it was...  ""Eerie 911. Will this be police, fire, or medical?"" Tish had picked up on the 2nd ring. ""Ginny? Ginny Lynn? Is that you? "" The normally loquacious Shiloh queried.  ""Shiloh? Hey! Is everything okay?"" Tish inquired. Tish was the nickname given to her by her boyfriend, Craig, who Ginny never called by that name. His nickname was Gomez. They were the local Halloween decorating contest champions and adored everything scary, thus the nicknames given to each: Gomez and Morticia from Addams family fame. ""Naw, Ginny girl. Ain't okay at all."" Ol Shiloh was not himself. ""What's happening?"" Tish's mounting concern was palpable.  ""Nothing right now. It was last night."" Ol Shiloh spoke, barely above a whisper.  Remaining ever so patient, Tish replied, ""What happened last night, Shiloh? You don't sound like yourself, and it's worrying me."" ""Ginny, don't you worry your pretty lil head about me. Harry & Virginia did a fine job raising you. Guess it didn't take in your lil sister, considering she turned out to be the town doorknob. Everybody's had a turn at that girl."" Granted, Ol Shiloh was never known to mince his words, but this was strong even for him. What was even worse? He wasn't wrong. Time to get him reigned back in. ""Well, I don't think you called to talk to me about my sister's promiscuity. What's going on with you, Shiloh?"" Tish was sensing his reluctance to just ""spit it out. "" It was as if he was having 2nd thoughts about placing the call to begin with.  ""I had visitors last night."" Shiloh barely spoke above a whisper. ""Visitors?"" Tish queried. Ol Shiloh never had visitors. Hell, he'd been living all by himself every since Rose died. His saintly wife was married to him 50 years, only a month before she passed away from a fatal heart attack. To say Ol Shiloh was lost? That was an understatement. Shiloh was nothing without Rose. He met her in August of 68, right after he came back stateside from Vietnam in May of that same year. It was love at 1st sight for Ol Shiloh, but Rose needed convincing. She mistakenly thought Shiloh was ""a Mama's boy"" because he worshipped the ground Rose walked on. He was not. He was simply in love for the 1st and last time. Tish was really surprised with how well Ol Shiloh was able to pull through the 2nd roughest time in his life with the aid of Eerie's townsfolk. And? As Elton John famously quoted? When it comes to Ol Shiloh? I'm still standing. This? This was different. This was not the Shiloh she'd known for the last 53 years of her life. ""Ginny, they were kids. Well, they looked like kids, but..."" Ol Shiloh trailed off. He shut down again. ""Looked like kids? What made you think they weren't kids, Shiloh?"" Tish was nervous and ancy. This felt wrong. Something was off. ""There were 2 of them. A boy, dark hair, pale skin, and probably about 12 years old. He had a lil girl with him about 7, also dark hair & pale skin."" Shiloh was intrepid. Tish quietly listened as Gomez and some of the other deputies were laughing in the office behind her. She gave them a scornful look, and the guys piped down. ""They'd knocked at my front door about an hour after the sun went down. I didn't have the porch light on. The screen door was shut and locked, but the wooden door was open. I turned the porch light on so I could see them better. They were both looking down at their feet. The boy whispered something but I couldn't hear, so I asked him to speak up,"" Shiloh let the flood gates burst forward. ""Sir? May we use your phone? We've gotten lost and are scared. We need to call our mother. Please, let us in."" The dark-haired boy requested.  ""I've not seen you kids around here before in my life. Who's your parents?"" Shiloh knew everyone in Eerie, Indiana, but he'd never seen these odd looking kids.  ""Sir? Please, let us in. We need to call our mother. She'll be so worried."" The dark-haired boy practically recited word for word what he'd already previously said, which really riled Shiloh up. ""Boy, you deaf?"", I asked, ""Who's your folks?"" Shiloh continued to give Tish the play by play. ""Sir? Please. We are cold. We are hungry and we are scared. Please, let us in."" The dark-haired boy sounded rehearsed and mechanical.  ""NO! There's something not right here."" Ol Shiloh didn't survive a hot tour in the jungle because he didn't have good instincts. ""Sir, please, if you could just let us in."" The little dark-haired girl then chimed in. Ol Shiloh knew instinctively not to trust these 2 but found himself being drawn to them paradoxically. His hand reached for the storm door to open it even though every fiber in his being told him not to. ""What the hell are you kids cause you ain't human?!"" Ol Shiloh was more nervous now than when he was a tunnel rat. Both children looked up and to Shiloh simultaneously. What he saw scared him worse than any night he'd spent in jungle. Their eyes were black, not just the pupil. The Iris, cornea, and pupil were all black but not just any black. The deepest black, pure obsidian. The answers to all of the galaxy's most burning questions were in those pitch black bottomless depth eyes.  ""Shiloh Svengaard, let us IN!"" both children stared into Shiloh's pale milky blue eyes as he stared back into their black ones. ""NO. NO, NOW GO AWAY!"" Shiloh slammed the wooden door and locked it. He watched as the black eyed children walked to the end of his driveway and onto James Dean Boulevard. They went off into the night and Ol Shiloh didn't see them anymore. ""So, you thought they'd return?"" Tish was a tad overwhelmed. Ol Shiloh had audio and visual hallucinations but it was always fellow soldiers, the Viet Cong or the North Vietnamese Army. It sure as hell wasn't black eyed tweens.  ""Ginny girl, I don't think they'll return. I know it. They're coming for me. I know they are."" Delusions of persecution certainly isn't anything new to Tish when it came to Ol Shiloh but this was different. Shiloh was full of doubt and self defeat. Never in his life had Ol Shiloh backed down from a fight. This? This was uncharted territory. ""Want Don to swing by on patrol tonight? Craig and I are having a lil evening out so he won't be on. Don would be glad to do it, Shiloh. Really."" Comforting and reassuring Ol Shiloh was Tish's main concern at the moment.  ""Yeah, Ginny Girl. Have Don cruise by my place if he would. Maybe a patrol car will keep these evil fucking little bastards away from me and my house. Best part of those lil sons a bitches dripped down their Mama's leg when she was getting pregnant with 'em!"" Ol Shiloh always had a way with words. ""Okay. I'll tell him but remember to use the non emergency line next time, Shiloh. Can't tie 911 up with non emergent calls."" Tish gently scolded. ""Fuck that non emergency number, Ginny girl! It prompts me to press 1 for English and 2 for the ESPENOIL (pronounced ESPN OIL) and bullshit! I just call 911 and get ahold of you!"" Shiloh wasn't about to call an automated line. That just wasn't how he did things. Tish was the one that could handle his problems. She was the good sister. ""Okay, okay, Shiloh. I'll tell Don. You just take it from me. Rose wouldn't want to see you like this."" Tish was truly concerned. ""Ginny girl, my Rosie can't see anything anymore."" And with that? He hung up the phone. The guys were still hanging out in the office, albeit much quieter.  ""Sorry 'bout that. We didn't know you were on the phone. We wouldn't have been telling jokes if we knew you were on the phone."" Gomez sheepishly looked down at the table where he was seated with 2 other deputies, Don & Bubba.  ""It wouldn't have mattered. Ol Shiloh was ranting so much he didn't even hear you guys."" Tish dismissed. ""Ol Shiloh? What put a hair across his ass?"" Don asked. ""He said 2 kids came by last night about an hour after dark, wanting to be let in the house. He was uncharacteristically afraid. He said they just kept repeating to let them in so they could call their mother. He felt something was off, something wasn't right."" Tish trailed off. ""Kids? Whose kids?"" Gomez spoke up.  ""He didn't know. He even asked the kids who their parents were but they just kept asking to come in the house."" Tish replied. ""Anyway, he said when he really got scared was when both kids looked up at him and their eyes were black. Their eyes were completely black."" Tish kept relaying everything Ol Shiloh told her. Gomez, Don & Bubba looked at her as if she'd grown a 2nd head. ""I'm just telling you what he said."" Tish defended. ""When he saw those black eyes? He panicked, slammed and locked the wooden door and told them to go away. They did."" Tish finished. ""So what does Lt. Dan want us to do with a couple of kids with colored contacts pranking the local crazy Vietnam Vet?"" Don sighed. ""I offered for you to swing by his place on patrol tonight. He was pleased with that."" Tish informed. ""FFS. Fine. Bubba and I can swing by a few times tonight as long as it shuts that old crazy bastard up."" Don resigned to his fate. ""You know, Don? No one will ever accuse you of being too caring."" Tish just rolled her eyes. ""BTW? What was the joke you guys were laughing at?"" Tish suddenly remembered.  ""There was a young Indian warrior who asked the tribe's chief one day how he decided on all of the babies' names when they were born since he was given the honor of naming all of the children""... Bubba began. ""He said, ""My son, if there is an eagle flying over when a child is being born? I call that child Eagle Flying Over. If there is snow gently falling when a child is being born? I call that child Snow Gently Falling, but tell me, Two Dogs Fucking, why do you ask?"" Bubba finished to a 2nd round of uproarious laughter. ""For Christ's sake, Bubba. You ain't got a lick of sense!"" Gomez wiped a tear of laughter from his eye and proceeded to leave he and Don in charge while he and Tish left for the day.  They got into the SUV and headed towards the Blue Bayou Creole restaurant. Most quaint and quirky hometowns have that one little restaurant everyone loves. The Blue Bayou was Eerie, Indiana's version. The seafood buffet on Friday nights were always a hit. As much as Tish & Gomez were home bodies? They did enjoy an occasional night at the Blue Bayou.  Bubba and Don drank coffee and told more dirty jokes. Swinging by Ol Shiloh's place a few times tonight will help break up the monotony. Poor ol bastard didn't mean any harm. He was just messed up in the head. Kids with all black eyes? What the hell was that all about, anyway?  Ol Shiloh really wanted to believe Tish. He really did. He knew, deep down inside, if Ginny, Craig and the boys at Eerie PD couldn't help him? No one could. Well, he has his shot gun on the rack, but who would threaten to shoot children? He saw enough of that shit cleaning out villages of their denizens back in jungle. He never intended to live that kind of hell, again. Strange looking kids or not, they still at least looked like kids. He just couldn't bring himself to shoot a child.  He was nodding off in his recliner. The sun was dipping below the horizon.  Tish & Gomez sat and ate and caught up with the day's activities. ""Ol Shiloh was really that scared, huh?"" Gomez asked Tish in a low voice so others couldn't overhear. ""Yeah. Yeah, he was. It was unsettling."" Tish was clearly still bothered. ""I'll remind Don later on tonight when I check in, I promise."" Gomez reassured. ""Please, do. I've never heard fear in his voice before. It's really got me shook."" Tish slowly relaxed and let the stress melt away as she took another spoonful of gumbo. ""Consider it done."" Gomez smiled and began eating as well.  Was it a knock? He couldn't be sure. The house was dark but Shiloh knew his own home. He slowly got up from the recliner and proceeded to the door. Could it be? He hoped not. Even as much as he knew those little demons were going to return? He had really hoped he'd be wrong. One quick look through the glass of the wooden door proved he was not. There they were: same dark-haired pale boy and girl but there was something different this time. There was a 3rd party out there but the darkness prevented him from making out who it was. This 3rd party was taller and bigger, clearly an adult but that was the only clear thing.  ""Please, Shiloh, let us in. We're cold. We're hungry. Our mother is worried."" Both children said in unison. The 3rd party waited in the wings.  ""I don't know you little mother fuckers so how did you know my name?"" Shiloh raged. He was still scared but more angry now.   ""Rosie told us."" Both children simultaneously chirped happily.  Wait, what? Rosie? Rosie as in my Rosie? The Rosie I cruelly lost just 4 January's ago? ""ROSIE? What the hell you mean Rosie?"" Ol Shiloh thought that he'd lost what little mind he had left. Just then? Something happened that flipped Ol Shiloh's world upside down.   ""Shiloh Shenandoah? Is that you, my love?"" Rosie. It was Rosie. Bigger than shit, it was his beloved wife of over 50 years. How, though? It couldn't be. He saw her on the slab in the morgue when he had to identify her. It couldn't be. She was 4 years in the ground! Yet, there she stood behind the black eyed children looking at him with the same set of obsidian black eyes.  ""Rosie? That can't be you. You died a month after our 50th wedding anniversary! You've been gone 4 years!"" Ol Shiloh's mind was reeling and he didn't know what to do.   ""Don't you love me, anymore, my dear? I thought you'd be so happy to see me."" Rosie smiled a smile that would have otherwise been beautiful if it weren't sitting below 2 pitch black eyes.   ""Don't ask silly questions, Rosie. You're the only one for me. You always have been. You always will be."" Shiloh was opening the screen door. The dark-haired pale children grabbed the storm door from the other side and pulled, Rosie with her sinister grin and black eyes moved forward.   ""Let us in, Shiloh."" The children and Rosie crossed the threshold and, immediately afterwards? Shiloh let out a scream coming from the death throws. As painful as it was? At least the ripping out of his throat by the children's mouths was, mercifully, quick.  ""Bubba! You are one redneck, peckerwood cracker!"" Don rolled his eyes as he drove along at a steady pace patrolling. ""You know I'm right! You just don't want to admit it!"" Bubba was getting equally irritated with Don in his response. Don's wife, Allison, was, indeed, Tish's little sister. She was also ""the town doorknob"" as Old Shiloh not so eloquently called her. She was well known to everyone as Eerie's town slut even though she married Don 10 years ago. Guess it's true what the song says, you can't turn a ho into a housewife.  ""Dude, I know you love her but she's always gonna be the town whore, Man"" Bubba tried backpedaling at least some.  ""Will you shut up? Will you just shut the fuck up? I'm tired of hearing this shit!"" Don lost it and blew up on Bubba. Bubba, in turn, shut down and stopped speaking.  They rolled onto James Dean Boulevard and proceeded to Ol Shiloh's place. It was dark, lonely and isolated. Shiloh was never one for neighbors, but something seemed even more off. Something just didn't seem right. Isn't that what Tish described earlier when Shiloh spoke to her on the phone? She said she heard fear. They'd never known Ol Shiloh to be fearful. Today? All of that changed.  Don & Bubba slowly crept up Shiloh's long driveway. Don tried rolling the spotlight on the cruiser up onto Shiloh's front porch. It was still a weak beam of light but was getting brighter. ""What the fuck?"" Don hit the brakes. ""What is it?"" Bubba looked at Don like he was absolutely crazy. ""The door is open. Actually? Both of them are."" Don shone the spotlight onto the open screen and wooden doors. They could tell both doors were open but could see nothing else due to the darkness.   ""I don't like this, Bubba."" Don was intrepid and softly pressed on the accelerator.   ""Don, should we call Tish & Gomez? I mean, I know it's their night out but..."" Bubba trailed off.  They sat in the driveway next to Ol Shiloh's porch. Other than both front doors being open? They couldn't see a thing.   Don and Bubba slowly approached the porch, guns drawn. It was dark but something was lying just inside the open front doors. As they advanced? It was boots. Jump boots that had a high polish shine. Those boots were connected to legs. Shiloh's legs.  ""Jesus Christ, call for a bus!"" Don yelled for Bubba to radio in for an ambulance.  Shiloh laid at the entrance to his home, flat on his back, staring with dead cold wide open eyes straight to and through the ceiling. A look of abject horror plastered all over his face. His throat was ripped out almost to his spinal cord.  ""Oh, God, I'm gonna puke!"" Bubba ran back outside where the evening's coffee went all over the sidewalk.  ""Call the coroner, too. This is gonna be a God damn circus!"" Don didn't attempt to get a pulse considering Shiloh's carotid arteries and jugular veins had been viciously ripped out.   Bubba wiped his mouth and started calling all of the necessary people. Don stood next to Shiloh with his hands holding his head in disbelief.  ""Our 1st kill was a success."" The dark-haired pale boy said to the creature that looked like Rosie.   ""It was this time. We must improve. We must refine. If we don't evolve? We wither and die. What would the point be to just stop at the 1st kill? The colony could never advance if we never pursued other avenues to further our agenda."" The creature that looked like Rosie opined.  The dark-haired pale boy and girl nodded in sync with everything the creature that looked like Rosie said. Is this how their occupation of Terra was really going to commence? Given everything the Alliance taught them? They thought the humans would be more violent and aggressive. Perhaps? The distant study of the  Terrestrials proved incorrect in practice in comparison to theory. Perhaps the Terrestrials will gladly cease resistance when they realize just how futile it will be.

You see in the final boss zone ""final zone"" if you look in the background, you might spot a....face. With A pair of purple eyes. You see, I would like to call this thing, the over-ruler. This is the most powerful thing sonic has ever fought, 3 dimensional or 2 dimension or not. Dr egg man or robotnik....stated that he doesnt start polution. But in oil ocean zone, the whole point is kinda pollution. So why? Because the over-ruler is the one controlling him, in fact, dr egg mans goal isnt to control the world, its to achieve world domination, and give it to the over ruler, and most importantly leave the over-ruler. Every conflict, small or not in every form of sonic media is controlled by the over ruler. This ""evil force"" is radioactive. Believe it or not sonic after the final fight in sonic 1 wasn't pure. The slight radiant force of the over ruler has that effect. Even on ones who are not evil at all. The reason why knuckles was able to get tricked by egg man 2 times is because egg man didnt- it was the over-ruler.  Eggman wants to take control of the world so hard because after all these years - he wants to escape. But he just cant. Interpret this how you will, but remember one thing, beware the over-ruler, and if you think this is a fake thing and just is a sonic thing. I have spent hours in the final zone of sonic 1. Replaying the game or the stage over and over again, and at the end of those hours...I felt the slight urge to take over the world.",scarystories,4,2023-06-13 18:23:02

Its lonely glow used to instill fear in me, now the idea of a full moon gets my blood pumping.    This night is no exception.      There will be excruciating pain for the first few minutes, but that will fade. In its place will be the clarity of the hunt. My vision will sharpen in the darkness and my nose will pick up scents I didn't even know existed until now.      No drugs compare to the exhilaration one receives when on the heels of prey. I can hear it's heart beating faster as the fear sets in. I look and see the shifting gaze of its eyes.¬†    It thinks to run, but it doesn't know that I was forged for the chase. This is the law of nature, the strong live and the weak die. I pull up right behind, then I fall away. The hunt is too short, so I like to draw it out.¬†      It runs on two legs, how stupid. Does it not know it could move twice as fast on all fours. It's quick for a human, much faster than me. The moon is shining bright tonight, which means I'm in my true form.      There is no hope for him.      He makes a wrong turn in the forest of stone. This forest is strange, not like any of the others. The trees touch the sky, and its bark is made of rock. It matters not, because there is plenty of food here.¬†    The weak ones think they are safe in their nests of stone and metal. Sometimes they are, but this one made a mistake. He went between two of them and trapped himself in the alleyway.¬†      Now he's mine.      I look up to see the moon nearly hidden behind the sky trees and let out one more howl. Tonight, it's the howl of victory, another night filled with meat and blood. I howl now because tomorrow I may not get the chance.",scarystories,2,2023-06-13 17:41:55
55,M.O.N.S.T.E.R. Nursery,148q4gq,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148q4gq/monster_nursery/,Thick_Mick_Chick,"*Note* This is Horror/Comedy if that isn't your thing.    Let me be the first to welcome you to the Mother/Offspring, Nurturing/Support, Teaching/Education Resource Network, or? M.O.N.S.T.E.R. Nursery. My name is Sassy, short for Sasquatch. Yes, THAT sasquatch. Are there other kinds?! I'm a HCC (Healthcare Cryptid) here at the nursery. I also teach humans the survival basics of coming across a baby monster in the woods.  Anyhoo, you're probably wondering why Sasquatch are utilized as Labor and Delivery nurses. It's simple, really. We're natural born mothers. You see, we just love babies! We always have! All of that nonsense about whooping, tree knocking and vocalizations that we do in the woods when you guys are camping? Don't get scared! That's just us shouting out to our boys letting them know we have humans in the woods! Humans could possibly have a BABY with them. Now, I don't like to judge based on looks, but those bald human babies are so ugly? They're cute! Poor little things look like they have mange, though. Who would think a bald puppy is cute? Ew.  I digress. So, when it came to the M.O.N.S.T.E.R. Nursery? We were the natural choice. Even though I happen to be female? History tells us that male nursery nurses happen to have the best bonding with our little devils. Well, little devils and whoever else was born that day. Just look at Chewy over there bonding with that litter of werewolf pups born on the last full moon. He's so maternal? He's practically a breast.  Now, all babies are not created equal. Have you ever wondered which monster's baby is the loudest? I can promise you that you'd rather listen to that werewolf pup litter any day over being 5 minutes late with Baby Siren Head's bottle. I had a headache for a week. When Vlad and Countess Bathory had their little undead bundle of joy last month? You'd be surprised how quick a Bigfoot can prick and milk their finger to get a fresh bottle of nutritious blood for that adorable, pale little parasite. He definitely had a healthy appetite, especially if you were B positive. Vlad and Countess Bathory couldn't have been happier. Patient satisfaction has always been a priority for HCCs (Healthcare Cryptid) since day one! We've never gotten below a 5 on the Jack Link's scale of 0 - 5 jerkies. We are collectively very proud of this fact! It's such an accomplishment for Bigfoot and all of Sasquatch kind.   Okay, I could understand why you think we're a little full of ourselves. I, mean, when Sasquatch are the chosen ones to be the top requested HCC? It's a far fall to the 2nd position. Look, we can't all be God's Chosen Ones. Yes, he exists. Yes, he created us. You're getting distracted, again. We aren't all going to argue semantics on what is Creationism and what is Darwinism and all of that. I'm too busy trying to teach incompetent, um *cough cough*, INTERESTED humans how to provide the most basic care for any creature's neonates (medical term for newborn) that they might stumble across while enjoying hiking, camping, fishing, etc. The priority? The newborn. Additional concerns?   1) Mother/Father finding humans around newborn and attacking them.  2) Humans treating the scenario like an episode of ""Jack Ass"" and thinking it's a good idea to ""mess with"" the newborn and? Again? Mom/Dad attacks them.   3) Basically? A human breathing will set Mom/Dad off. Most creatures just don't want humans around. They can't be trusted. Sorry, Guys. It's been that way every since you refused to credit Chewy in the '67 Patterson‚ÄìGimlin film.   So? Your first reaction, if you see a baby creature? Look for it's parents. If you see them? Run. Run fast. Like, put Forrest Gump to shame kinda runnin'. Those parents don't want you there for any reason at all. Pick 'em up and put 'em down the whole way back down the trail.   If you don't see the parents? Proceed slowly and with caution. Now, don't let everything I've said scare you into not helping a baby monster. They're babies, after all. Please, check on them. Just be aware of your surroundings so as not to frighten the wood creatures which will, in turn, attack you. Then? It's just a bad day for everyone involved.   So? Depending on the woodland creature? You'll want to know what action you need to take to help the baby and? Hopefully? Survive assisting. The first thing you'll want to do is call out/whistle, whatever you have to do to try to get someone's attention. Look around and listen. What do you see and hear? If it's nothing? Again, proceed with caution. If you hear howling, growling, tree knocking, whooping, any of these things? Leave, either their parents are still around or we're there and will then takeover. I know. It's confusing to try to tell when we're tree knocking hoping you have a baby with you or if we know there's a baby around and we don't want you around the baby. Really, if at all possible, just don't mess with the babies if you don't have to. With that having been said? Let's proceed!  As you cautiously approach? Keep making noise letting everyone know you're there. We don't want to scare the life, or afterlife, out of these little ones. They're at their most vulnerable right now. Let's use Chewy's patients today as an example. You traipse along and stumble over a werewolf den. Well, that's not something you see every day. You hear soft whimpering. About 4 or 5 little werewolf pup heads pop up out of the den. How's everyone looking? Is anyone hurt? No? Then check your supplies. It just so happens you were successful fishing earlier. Werewolf pups love fish almost as much as moonbathing and cutting their baby teeth on a human femur. They'll be thankful, the Alpha male and female will be thankful and you'll really be thankful. You get to walk away, karma and limbs intact.   Next? It would be highly likely that you'd come across a wendigo, skinwalker, rake slenderman, etc. besides just a litter of werewolf pups. Try to prepare yourself as much as possible for these encounters. The better prepared? The better off everyone will be. The best part? These creatures won't want your everlasting soul in infancy. Those challenges don't present until adolescence. So? Enjoy the respite for the moment. Now? No matter what the situation? You'll always want to approach with caution and announce your arrival. It's saved not only many a human? It's saved a lot of cryptids as well. Try to have some sort of food item on you that's rather filling. You'd prefer that over them making YOU the food item.   So, as we proceed down the trail, there's a cabin to the left and it's the last house but do not enter, please. The last good hearted Samaritan did and, well, let's just say he had a run in with a girl locked in the cellar who wasn't quite herself. That's probably about the most PC way of explaining demonic possession. Anyhoo, there was bad press for a year and visitors to the park fell off, it just was a big mess. They ended up doing some kind of cybernetic enhancement and now the good Samaritan has a chainsaw for an arm. He's done a great job keeping them all in line. Overall? That was one we got right.  Since I brought up Vlad and the Countess Bathory's bouncing little bundle of bloodsucker? It's important to know that if you are in your domicile, and R.V.'s count, vampires cannot enter without an invitation from you. So, if you are camping in your R.V. and someone comes knocking late at night? Don't answer. If they aren't a vampire? They can come back the next day. If they don't come back? You definitely made the right decision. Now, the problem is? If you encounter a vampire in the wild. Hopefully? They've already set their sights on whoever they picked that night to be their victim. If not? A dropper of Holy Water as perfume on either side of your neck is a nice deterrent. Again, if the little count is there by himself? He's clearly gotten away from the castle. He needs returned immediately. Go to the nearest tree that displays a ""break in case of emergency"" box. Break the glass, take the bag of beef jerky out, shake it. Every Sasquatch in a 5 mile radius will come running to you. Point the baby vampire out and we'll be glad to take it from there.   Something I should bring up to our do-gooders ready to risk it all: if you can't swim? Don't try to help aquatic creatures. It won't end well. It never does. Little fry just aren't acclimated to landlubbers. Merpups are tough for even us to handle. They get scared, you can't swim, bad things happen. So? If you're determined to help any baby monster no matter where they reside? Take swimming lessons. You'll thank me. Trust me on this.  Don't let the fae trip you up, either. They're mischievous. They'll also try to sneak a changeling in on you if you do bring your human babies to the forest. If you respect walking around fairy rings and respect mother nature? The fae shouldn't be an issue. If you don't? Well, you were warned.   So, what have we not covered? Flying creatures. Yes, they present a challenge even we Sasquatch find difficult. It's hard to assess the needs of a baby that's wrapped in the arms of a mother flying 75 feet above your head. Even though the task is daunting? It's a challenge we'll definitely take on. We just watch and wait for Mom to go on the hunt and we take a peak at that tiny little velociraptor in that nest, with it's mouth hanging wide open, just awaiting a morsel. Now, the Mothman's baby was an experience. Cocoons are just something you have to see for yourself, especially when they're 6 feet tall. It's truly fascinating!   I think that covers everything for today's lesson. Bear in mind, we're beginning the summer season here in the U.S. Encounters are going to increase between cryptids and humans so be aware and care when it comes to our babies. We're aware and care when it comes to yours. Stay safe and Sasquatch on!",scarystories,0,2023-06-13 17:28:04
56,Song of Soliloquy,148pyeq,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148pyeq/song_of_soliloquy/,Thick_Mick_Chick,"If there was one thing Soliloquy hated? She really hated being proven wrong. She knew she couldn't be right about everything but she HATED being 100% sure she was wrong. It made her look stupid and stupid was something Soliloquy most certainly was not.   She wasn't like the other kids. Mama said that was okay. We weren't meant to be like everyone else. What makes us different also makes us special. Soliloquy believed it because there's no way Mama would lie to her.   Mama was so smart. She'd picked up on all of the little things Soliloquy did as a baby and, then, a toddler. Mama knew Soliloquy was such a ""special"" girl. Only she truly believed in Soliloquy. She'd never known her Daddy. Mama didn't care for talking about him too much. From what little Mama did say about him? It's probably better off that way.   She'd been so little when the first incident happened. Mama knew for certain then. There'd been no doubt left in Mama's mind. Mama had been busy and didn't get Soliloquy's bottle warmed up for her in a timely fashion. She was just a baby and had no way of controlling her anger. It wasn't poor Mama's fault, either. She had her hands full being a single mother. It just exploded. Mama said that it scared her so! She was grateful she hadn't been close to the microwave because the glass went everywhere. Mama knew from that day that she could never be late with Soliloquy's bottle ever again.  Now? This turdy boy thinks a tomato is a fruit?! Why would he think that?! EVERYONE knows tomatoes are vegetables!  ""Dummy! I'm trying to tell you! If you weren't so freaking poor? Maybe you could afford a cell phone and Google it, Stupid!"" Grover Dill was not a nice, cute, clean nor smart boy. All he was to Soliloquy was trouble and headaches. He'd bullied her every since kindergarten and he hadn't let up one day from then until now. He hasn't even slowed down in the 6th grade. Mama always tried to talk Soliloquy down when he tormented her so. She really hoped she made it home this time so Mama could do it, again. Soliloquy knew if she had another ""spell""? Mama would be so disappointed. Please, please, please, let her make it back home, again.  ""At least I'm not named after a Sesame Street muppet!"" Soliloquy could feel tears sting her eyes.   ""And your name means you talk to yourself!"" Grover just had to say something. He couldn't just let it go.   She was walking away. She was trying so hard. It was happening, though. She wasn't getting flushed. She was getting HOT!  ""GROVER CLAUDE DILL! DON'T SAY NOTHIN' ELSE TO ME!"" Soliloquy was burning up.  ""NOTHIN', WHITE TRASH!"" Grover was cackling and Soliloquy was coming unglued.  She kept trying to distract herself. It wasn't helping. Where would it go this time? What would it mean? She should ""put it"" somewhere. But put it where?  ""Back off! Calm down!"" Soliloquy shut her eyes and kept repeating the 2 phrases, over and over, more to herself than anyone. Something was cracking, splitting, something was breaking!  Soliloquy opened her eyes to see Grover Dill standing underneath a tree with a very heavy branch that was cracking and breaking. Of course? Being the hillbilly, redneck, The Hills Have Eyes inbred that he is? He was too busy cackling like an old mountain witch to notice.   ""I should tell him. I should. Mama would be disappointed, but I just can't take anymore of him!"" Soliloquy debated with her conscience. She knew it was wrong. You ain't suppose to be doin' wrong. Sweet little baby Jesus, she just couldn't take him, anymore. So? Soliloquy settled on, ""What Mama don't know won't hurt her.""   She looked up at the branch. It honestly could've went either way, at that point. She knew which way it would go this time.  The tree branch groaned in protest as it continued to break away from it's perch. Then? CRAAAAAAACK! In the words of John Mellencamp (one of Mama's favorites since she's from Indiana, too)? It came ""Crumblin' Down.""   It all seemed to happen in slow motion. The branch completely broke free and plummeted towards Grover's useless head. Soliloquy thought, ""It's going to be more useless in about 3 more seconds."" And? Soliloquy stifled a giggle.  Boom! Soliloquy couldn't believe what she'd seen. The branch fell on Grover just as he threw his head back to laugh harder. BAM! Smack in his face! Grover let out a guttural scream as the branch slammed his face and the rest of his body folded like an accordion as he fell to the sidewalk. He was breathing really funny and it sounded wet. Oh, no. She thought it would just knock him out! This was more than she could deal with. Mama would know how to handle this. She was so sure of it!   ""Better look around and see if anyone was watching."" Soliloquy began scanning the school, playground and sidewalk she was on. School had been over for awhile. No one was around. Don't ask? Don't tell. She ran all the way home.  Contrary to the skid mark named Grover Dill's opinion? She most certainly was not white trash. It was true that all that Mama could afford was a trailer. The trailer was clean and Soliloquy had her own room and she was happy. She didn't have a problem so why did that poster child for abortion have to say such mean and hurtful things? Did that make him deserving of a death sentence? As Soliloquy peaked the little hill right before her house? She saw Mama out in the front yard. Thank the Lord! She'll know what to do.   ""Soliloquy, Baby? That you?"" Mama looked up as she rounded the corner. Soliloquy ran to her until she almost passed out.  ""Mama! I didn't mean to, Mama!"" Soliloquy began to plead her case just as soon as she saw her.  ""Baby! What's happened?"" Mama's furrowed brow let Soliloquy know she was very concerned.   ""Mama! I swear, Mama!"" Soliloquy finally reached Mama and hugged her like she'd never let go.   ""Come inside, Baby, and tell me what happened."" Mama took Soliloquy inside and they both sat on the couch. Soliloquy was so happy to be home if not happy about her circumstance.  ""Mama! It was Grover, again!"" Soliloquy was tearing up   ""What did he do this time, Soliloquy?"" Mama asked as if she were irritated that his name even got brought up.  ""I didn't know, Mama. I really thought tomatoes were vegetables. Grover told me they are actually fruit."" Soliloquy timidly approached the subject.  ""And that was the fight?"" Mama knew there had to be more to this.  ""No, there was more. That's just what started it."" Soliloquy replied and Mama nodded her head in acknowledgement.   ""He just wouldn't stop, Mama. He just..."" Soliloquy burst into tears.  ""Soliloquy? Did you have another spell?"" Mama always got right to the point.   Welp. There it was. The time to cough it up. ""I tried not to, Mama. Please, believe me!""   ""Soliloquy? Tell me what happened and tell me what happened right now. I'm not angry, but I do need to know."" Mama was getting more upset.  ""Deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth."" Soliloquy said to herself.  ""Okay. We kept arguing and he was saying really nasty things and I was getting so mad, Mama!"" She couldn't hold back.   ""He was really hurtful and hateful and I... I....."" Soliloquy tapered off.  ""You had a spell?"" Mama already knew.  ""Yes, Mama. I did."" Soliloquy replied and stayed silent.  ""How bad was it, Baby?"" Mama resigned herself to the fate of knowing it has most certainly happened, again.   ""Bad, bad, Mama."" Soliloquy placed her head in her hands and openly sobbed.   ""Baby? Is he dead?"" Mama needed to know.  ""I don't know, Mama. I just don't know."" Soliloquy was racked with sobs.  ""Baby, this isn't your fault. I was hoping it wouldn't get this bad. I was hoping it'd would never go this far. This is something you just can't control. There's no way you can when you get older. It happened to me, too."" Mama said without realizing she'd just turned Soliloquy's world upside down.  What did she mean it happened to her, too? Wait, what?  ""Mama? What do you mean it happened to you?"" Soliloquy was certain she'd feel better once she talked to Mama but she most definitely was not feeling better.  ""Soliloquy, you've had these spells every since you were born. Well? Before you were born? I had them.""   Mama had the spells when she was younger, too?   ""I was born like you. I had spells from time to time and it was usually out of my control until I got older. I learned how to self soothe so nothing really bad happened. I thought it was all okay. I really did. Well, when I met your Daddy? I thought I'd never have another spell, again. I really did. I loved him so much. In the beginning? He was good to me, too. Then? Bethany. She just had to come along and screw it up. She was so much prettier and thinner than me and your Daddy just fell head over heels. I was crushed. I was devastated. How can I compete with skinny ass Methany? What could I do to make sure your Daddy stayed with me? Well, I thought of what women have thought of since time immemorial. I got pregnant. Your Daddy was happy at first. He really wanted you. As time went on? I got bigger and more unattractive as I got further along. Pregnancy isn't normally when a woman looks her best. Well, that just made your horn dog Daddy run to Bethany even more. I was losing him and couldn't do a thing about it. One day? A few weeks before I was due to have you? Your Daddy came to me and informed me that he's moving in with Bethany. He said he wanted nothing further to do with me and would see me in court over visitation and support. He very much wanted to be in your life, but not mine. Well, who in the hell does he think he is? I'll be damned if he's coming to see you but doesn't want me! So? As he stood at the bottom step of our front porch? Flames started licking his workboots and he screamed. I just laughed with delight the whole time he was burning up! When I had you? The ""spells"" moved onto you and left me."" Mama just smiled at Soliloquy like she just told her what the weather was like outside.   Soliloquy's head was spinning. Mama killed Daddy because he only wanted me and not her? No. NO! THAT'S NOT IT!  ""Mama, you just got mad and it got away from you, right?"" Soliloquy hoped she said yes.  ""Oh, no, Baby. The second he told me he wanted you but not me? I crisped him like bacon!"" Mama laughed. She actually laughed.   Soliloquy didn't know how to get out of this. Mama actually KILLED her Daddy. She never got to meet him. She never got to love him. She'd never known anything more than the crappy little podunk town she'd been born and raised in. She could've known more. She could've known nicer. She could've known better.  ""What's the matter, Baby? You look unhappy."" Was Mama actually serious? What's the matter? WHAT'S THE MATTER? SHE HAS GOT TO BE KIDDING!  It started happening. The flames licked onto the outside of the trailer and climbed up its walls and doors.  ""Soliloquy! What are you doing? Why are you burning up the trailer? Stop it this instant!"" Now Mama was the one angry.  ""No, Mama, I can't do that. You wanted me all to yourself. Well? Here I am. Both of us can head down to hell together."" Soliloquy looked at her with a sinister smile. It was then she just had to laugh. Sesame Street was on the T.V. behind Mama sobbing. Guess Grover got the last laugh after all.",scarystories,0,2023-06-13 17:20:35
57,Blackwood Mansion,148mjzx,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148mjzx/blackwood_mansion/,Argie_Bargie72,"There was a small town named Silverlake. It was a peaceful town with friendly residents. However, there was one particular house that stood out from the rest. It was an old mansion located in the outskirts of the town and was known as the ""Blackwood"" mansion.  It was said that the Blackwood mansion was cursed with evil spirits that haunted the house. No one knew why the spirits were there, but rumors spread that the previous owners had played with dark magic and summoned these spirits into their home.  One fateful night, a group of teenagers decided to explore the mansion, despite warnings from the townspeople. They entered the mansion and were immediately greeted with a chilling feeling. The air felt thick and heavy, and the silence was deafening.  The teenagers split up and explored different parts of the mansion. As they walked, they heard strange noises and whispers coming from the walls. Suddenly, they stumbled upon a locked room that felt colder than the rest of the mansion.  Deciding to investigate, they broke into the room. However, as soon as they entered, they were greeted with terrifying screams, and the doors behind them slammed shut, trapping them inside.  The room was dark, and the only source of light came from a single candle that flickered dimly in the corner. The window was sealed shut, and there was no way to escape.  As the night dragged on, the teenagers realized that they weren't alone in the room. The evil spirits had awakened and were now tormenting them. The teenagers were pushed and pulled, their bodies twisted and turned, as the spirits had their way with them.  The screams of the teenagers echoed throughout the mansion, but no one came to help. They had been cursed to the same fate as the previous owners of the mansion, and the evil spirits had no intention of letting them go.  The next day, the townspeople found the mansion locked and abandoned. The teenagers were never seen again, and their disappearance remains a mystery to this day. But some say that on quiet nights, you can hear their screams echoing through the walls of the Blackwood mansion.  Years went by, and the Blackwood mansion became a place of dread. People avoided the area at all costs, and those who dared to pass by said they could feel the spirits lingering around.  One day, a group of paranormal investigators decided to investigate the mansion. They wanted to get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding the mansion and the spirits that haunted it.  As they entered the mansion, they felt the same chilling feeling the teenagers felt before them. However, they didn't let that deter them. They were determined to find out what was going on.  They found the same locked room the teenagers had broken into years ago. The door was still sealed shut, but the investigators found a way to break it open.  But as they entered the room, they realized too late that they had made a grave mistake. The spirits that had been lying dormant had awakened once again, and they were angry.  The investigators tried to leave the mansion, but every door and window was locked and impossible to open. The spirits began to haunt them, twisting their minds and tormenting their souls.  Days went by, but the investigators could not escape the Blackwood mansion and the spirits that haunted it. Their bodies contorted and twisted, and their minds were driven to madness. They suffered the same fate as the teenagers before them.  In the end, the Blackwood mansion stood abandoned, a testament to the evil that still lurked within its walls. People avoided the area, and no one else ever dared to investigate.  But some say that on dark nights, if you listen carefully, you can still hear the screams of the paranormal investigators echoing through the halls of the Blackwood mansion.  The legend of the Blackwood mansion became even more terrifying after the tragedy that the paranormal investigators faced. The townspeople were now completely afraid of the place and started avoiding the area at all costs. They believed that the spirits that haunted the mansion needed to be put to rest, but no one knew how to do it.  One day, a woman named Emily, who had moved to the town recently, decided to visit the mansion after hearing the rumors from the locals. She was a spiritual healer and believed she could communicate with restless spirits and help put them to rest.  She entered the mansion, feeling a sense of unease, but her strong will overpowered it. Emily started communicating with the spirits, trying to understand why they were still haunting the mansion.  It was then that she found out the horrifying truth. The previous owners had been practicing black magic and had conducted human sacrifices in the mansion, which had awoken the evil spirits. The spirits that were once human were now consumed by darkness and wanted the same fate for anyone who entered the mansion.  Emily knew what needed to be done. She decided to perform a ritual to help those spirits move on and break the curse on the mansion once and for all. She lit candles in every room and started the ritual.  As the ritual went on, the spirits became more and more agitated. But Emily didn't lose her focus and continued her work. After what felt like hours, the spirits finally calmed down, and light started to enter the rooms.  As Emily completed the ritual, she felt a sense of relief and the mansion started to glow peacefully. The curse had been lifted from the Blackwood mansion, and it would never be haunted again.  The news of the mansion's purification and relief spread throughout the town. Hope returned to the hearts of the townspeople, and they credited Emily for what she had done.  However, Emily knew from experience that evil never stayed vanquished forever. But for now, the Blackwood mansion was at peace, and the town had been saved from its chilling curse.  The town had been at peace for many years after Emily lifted the curse on the Blackwood mansion, and people in the town had started forgetting the nightmares they had associated with that place. But as the years went by, the Blackwood mansion started calling out to people once again, slowly luring them into its depths.  One night, a group of college students decided to check out the old haunted house. In the beginning, everything seemed to be going fine, but as soon as they entered the mansion, the doors began to shut behind them. The temperature dropped drastically, and the students started feeling a sense of unease.  As they explored the mansion, they started noticing figures lurking in the shadows. Slowly, the figures started revealing themselves to be the evil spirits that once roamed the halls of the Blackwood mansion. The students were paralyzed with fear and could not move even as the spirits approached them.  One by one, the evil spirits started to consume the students, slowly torturing their souls and showing them the horrors that happened in this mansion before Emily had lifted the curse. The students screamed with terror, begging for God's mercy, but the spirits continued their relentless attacks and dragging their souls into the darkness.  Days later, the authorities found the bodies of the students, lying lifeless on the floor of the Blackwood mansion. The town was once again in shock, and the nightmares returned, with the spirits claiming new souls to torment for all eternity.",scarystories,1,2023-06-13 14:47:30
58,It Came At Night,148mcvc,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148mcvc/it_came_at_night/,oOo_INFJ_oOo,"My grandma, who is now passed, was the most amazing woman I have ever known.  I know this gets said often, we all believe our grandparents to be amazing.  My grandma was the most loving, kindhearted, open minded, religious and upright woman.  She raised three children and was the wife of a WWIII vet who had lost both his legs, so she was also his caregiver.  She had his hospital bed set up in the living room next to the big picture window so he could see outside and look at their 30 acres of property.  She slept in the bedroom right next to him so she could hear him, and if he needed anything, he would ring his little bell.  Her mother passed away, and soon after she started to receive visits from her at night. She decided to tell my dad about this, who is also a man of faith.  He asked her ""What happens when she visits?"".  She replied "" Well, we just talk."" He asked ""What about?"" and she said ""About anything and everything, we just talk."" He said. ""Well, next time she visits, ask her ""In Jesus name, who are you?"" and she agreed.  Not too long later, my grandma was laying in her bed and her mother came in her room to visit. She was standing at the end of the bed, and they had their talk, and when they were finished for the night, my grandma said ""Oh! By the way, I am supposed to ask you, ""In Jesus name, who are you?"". Then, what she thought was her mother, transformed into something else and said ""devil"" and disappeared.  If she were still alive, I know she would have wanted me to share this experience with others, so this is for her.",scarystories,0,2023-06-13 14:38:41
59,The Book,148lgs7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148lgs7/the_book/,Impressive_Cash_8069,"Hello, my name is Shadow. I stand at 5'4"" with long black hair and black colored eyes. I always knew I was different. I always knew I didn't belong with the rest of my family. They all were blonde haired beauties with bright blue eyes. I looked like a goth they adopted off of the street one day. I was always very into the paranormal and everything spooky, but I guess with my birthday being on Halloween it makes sense.    I don't know where else to write this so here I am. I feel so lost and confused. Honestly that doesn't even cut it. I'm terrified. I found something I don't think I was ever meant to find. I'm getting ahead of myself though. Let me go back to the beginning.   This morning I was cleaning my house, as I usually do on a Sunday. I grew up in this house, and it was left to me when my parents passed. It's a beautiful Victorian style home, and it almost looks like a mansion. I have explored every nook and cranny of this home. I even found a secret was to get behind the walls, so I would always win at hide and seek. Today was different though. Somehow in the last 4 years I must have never deep cleaned in my dad's old study.  Today while I was dusting the bookshelves I found a key I had never seen before. It looked old, like older than anything in the house aside from an old safe up in the attic. My dad never let us go into the attic, he claimed it was unsafe. I was a little adventurer as a child though, and once I found a secret way into the attic that became my favorite room. I smiled as I grabbed the key and ran to the attic door.   The attic has always been kind of dark with a musty smell, and tons of cobwebs. None of this ever bothered me. It always had a strange sort of peace to it. Gave me a nice place to run and hide when my siblings were being too much for me. The prior owners of the house left some porcelain dolls up here. I used to carefully play with them and have tea when my parents were out.   I opened the attic door and smiled when I saw the dolls still sitting around their table. They were quiet dusty, but that was to be expected after not being up here for 10 years. I walked over to the safe and tried to use the key. To my surprise it slid into the lock without any issues. My heart was racing with excitement as I turned the key, but nothing happened. How could this be? What else could this key be for, and why even have a safe without a key for it? I started to dust off the safe, trying to see if there was possibly another keyhole or even a hidden lock. I found nothing. Absolutely no other way to open the safe aside from the keyhole I first used.   Maybe on the bottom? I thought to myself. I attempted to pick up the safe, which was surprisingly light. Maybe there wasn't really anything inside. I set it down upside down, and to my dismay found nothing yet again. I sat on floor and tried to rack my brain for any other ideas of places I saw keyholes but couldn't enter. There has to be something somewhere in this house. As I went to stand up I noticed a line on the wooden floor that seemed out of place. Upon closer inspection I noticed it looked like the outlines of a trapdoor that was hidden under the safe.   That's odd. When did that get there? I gently blew the dust off the floor to get a better look at it. To my surprise there was a keyhole in the floor that was the same size as the one on the safe. Can't hurt to try right? I thought to myself as I tried the key. I slowly turned the key expecting it to not work, but to my surprise I heard it unlock. I carefully opened the trapdoor and to my surprise I found a small black box inside covered in dust. I took the box and went down to the living room eager to discover whatever was inside.   I sat down with a cup of tea in my favorite reading chair and opened the box. Inside was a little black book with yellowed pages. I gently opened the book and was surprised to find my dad's handwriting on the pages. What could have been so important that he had to hide this book in the floorboards?   The devil doesn't bargain they say. What if he did though? Is there a way to call him, and get your deepest desires fulfilled?   I couldn't believe what I was reading. My father never really believed in religion. Sure he believed in ghosts and demons, but he wouldn't have messed with anything right? I continued reading, and each page was set up as a journal entry.   10/22/1989   I think I finally figured out how to converse with the devil. The best night to do this will be Halloween. I hope everything works out well for me.   I sat in shock at what I had just read. My dad, the year before I was born, was looking to try and talk to devil? What could he have possibly wanted?   As I continued to read the journal entries, I felt a sense of dread wash over me. My father had been obsessed with the idea of making a deal with the devil, and had spent years researching and experimenting with various methods to summon him. He wrote about his growing desperation to achieve his deepest desires, and how he believed that the devil was the only one who could fulfill them.   As I read on, I discovered that my father had indeed made a deal with the devil on Halloween night in 1989. He had traded his soul for power, and influence in the world of politics. He had become a successful politician, rising quickly through the ranks to become one of the most powerful men in the country.   But his success came at a terrible price. As the years went by, my father's health began to deteriorate rapidly, and he was plagued by terrible nightmares and visions of hell. He became a recluse, rarely leaving his study, and eventually died alone in his room.   Reading my father's journal, I realized that I had stumbled upon something dark and dangerous. The key, the trapdoor, the black box - all of it had been carefully hidden away by my father, a warning to anyone who might try to follow in his footsteps.   I closed the journal and sat back in my chair, feeling overwhelmed by a sense of unease. I didn't know what to do with this information, or how to process the fact that my own father had made a deal with the devil. All I knew was that I had to be careful, and that I had to keep this secret hidden away from the world.   As I sat and contemplated what to do with the journal an intense feeling of dread started to wash over me. My breath caught in my throat as a rush of cold air entered the room. It was colder than the harshest winter wind I have ever felt. I froze in place as a looked at the floor and noticed my shadow looked a little too long in the lighting of the room. My shadow had gone from just being me in the chair to a large figure behind me. It appeared to be about 7' tall and built like a linebacker. I couldn't being myself to look behind me. I sat frozen in fear. My mind began to race.   Is this why the book was hidden so well? Did my dad bind the devil to the book when they made their deal? What could he have possibly wanted in return for giving my dad everything he wanted in the world of politics? This is why dad was so sick and the doctors couldn't help? My mind continued to race, and I was only snapped back to reality when the being behind me started to speak.   ""My child. How I have longed for this moment,"" a deep, raspy voice said behind me. I couldn't move. All I could think was that I needed to move. I needed to get out of here. I felt goosebumps on my arms as I watched the arm of the shadow move towards me.   ""It's time for you to come home. You weren't supposed to learn the secret yet. The secret must be kept. Time for you to come with me.""   Everything turned to black as soon as the voice finished speaking, and all was silent once again.       Rather than robots replacing human workers, both are mistreated by the rich as cheap labor. The eventual uprising wasn't just robots alone, but the poor and robots together, against their common enemy.",scarystories,0,2023-06-13 13:59:40
60,The shelter,148l92y,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148l92y/the_shelter/,TheFirstDeacon,"About 3 years ago I moved from a one hell hole into another, for context though the next flat I moved into was actually in a good area and it looked better than the last two places I'd lived in lived.  For the first two months everything was calm, I could come home after work and sleep without any problem, until my neighbours dog would start barking and I mean atleast 7 hours a day this dog would be off on one.  Then it started people would come to his flat and bang like hell on his door now partly I felt the need to be a responsible neighbour and call the police in order to keep him safe I mean this was an old man.  I was wrong, about a month of crap and me calling the police ended up in this old man breaking into my place, at first I didn't really notice due to drinking a little too much but things like underwear and other stuff went missing I didn't really put two and two together until I had a sober month, that's when I put up a camera.  It wasn't until a few more months later I started to realise this camera wouldn't pick up dark 'shiny' clothing until one day after an evening shift I came home and sat in my chair in pure darkness I could hear something shuffling near the front door.  (My flat had one door the front door and only windows at the front, one big window and a small window, welcome to basement flats in the UK I guess)  As I sat and listened trying to work out if it was just my mind playing tricks I mustered up the courage and banged on the wall of the hallway so I could see who was moving around or doing whatever the dog, a white akaita ran off first then the person.  I still don't know what the hell he was doing but I have my theories.  I confronted him the next day whilst angry and sober to no avail, he tried lying and saying he wasn't home.  I let it go up until I came home one day and there was a strange smell in my flat and I noticed the window in the bottom left corner had been jarred open.  I have a few thoeries as to what he was up to but it wasn't something I was interested in, it wasn't until I put a camera clock in my room I got the evidence I needed I saw him creeping through my room and sniffing and masturbating in my room, it made me feel sick but unfortunately there was no way to identify him due to him wearing a mask.  I knew it was him, from past interactions I just knew it was him.  One night I lost my temper and threatened him with a blank firing pistol (legal in the UK)  That night is the night I ended up in prison, now as scared as I was it wasn't overly bad being locked away for 22 hours a day it gives you time to think which will either send you crazy or change you, it changed me I hope for the better.  When I was finally released they told me I had nowhere to go, nowhere to live even though my licence conditions stated I needed a stable address to go to.  For around a month I kept to myself, hidden in the shadows of the city, in the loneliest of places, no friends, no family to help, I considered suicide, attacking people I considered a lot of things until I broke and I reached out to the salvation army I was tired of being wet, cold and I knew I smelt like shit especially after the McDonald's staff kicked me out.  They told me they had no spaces and put me in contact with the shelter, a group who provides winter accommodation temporarily, I agreed desperately, they picked a group of us up around 1600 and moved us into a building after about a 45 min drive I was disorientated due to the long drive.  Everything was ok to be honest a shower, a cooker, yeah you had to clean and yeah you had to cook for yourself I had no problem with that I've lived on my own for multiple years, I had no issue with that.  It was around a month later I'd finally been offered a job with a recruitment agency I was over the moon and I just went with but the caretaker of the building began to take interest in me for some reason, at first I just shrugged it off as him just making sure everything was ok until one day he knocked on my door and offered me food.  I took it happily without thinking anything, when your homeless and someone offers you food you kinda take it without question.  It wasn't until around two weeks later I started to question everything I started having these weirdos shakes and I felt like I was going through withdrawal of some sorts but I don't drink that much and I don't do drugs.  I started researching the shakes and what I found out was that if you eat human flesh you can experience similar effects.  I decided to investigate further before pointing the finger, one night I ended up staying up because I just could sleep so I snuck downstairs to the kitchen only to peer through the door and see the cook Vasili cutting up a body I cupped my hand over my mouth to stifle my gasp and quickly moved back to my room, I moved out of there last week and the stories I've heard all lead to the same conclusion they are feeding the homeless to the homeless, this is the first time I've shared this part of my story due to being scared they may be watching.  Somebody help me.",scarystories,5,2023-06-13 13:50:15

62,An Escape from Sanity,148io1t,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148io1t/an_escape_from_sanity/,strangely-evil,"Jerry didn't bother with anyone when he was in his car. His arms were firmly planted on the steering wheel, and his phone was on ""Do Not Disturb"" mode. The fear that his father's fate would one day be his own terrified him. He had developed a compulsion to take control, a result of his anxiety and his need to be a total control freak.   The overcast clouds hung heavily in the sky, and despite the early hour, darkness seemed to descend prematurely upon him. As he pondered the unusually bright red light, his usual irritation in traffic jams faded away. ""I really need to take that vacation"" he reflected, hoping it would provide a breath of fresh air.   But Jerry knew deep down that something was off, his phone blinking with several missed calls. The part of him that he had repressed until his father's death was now being questioned. A part of him that was not natural but self-imposed. Yet again, he chose to ignore it. The phone lay there, untouched, as he found himself at the heart of the city. Jerry observed the hustle and bustle around him but intentionally ignored it. The LED screens flashed with advertisements and news, increasing his heartbeat and causing his eyes to twitch towards his cell phone. The notifications stared back at him: 18 missed calls and a notification from a matrimonial app saying, ""Got a match!""   In search of solace he whirled the volume button and a dormant voice of a news anchor said 'The runways are yet to be identified but there are three of them who got out of the prison'   He scratched his half-grey beard and refocused on the road and saw food outlets.    The obsessive personalities have a tendency of repeating certain gestures to themselves, as they are stuck in a loop. Jerry was not different. As the missed calls kept coming, he started acting up.   His black sedan glided into a DriveThru, its windows opening to place an order. For a moment, the worker couldn't see the driver's face due to the smoke emanating from the car. Then, in an instant, Jerry's face emerged from the haze, smoking a cigarette and onion rings lodged in his beard. He ordered two big, greasy cheeseburgers and paid with cash.   The black sedan, mirroring its owner, exhaled an abnormal amount of smoke, as if it had never witnessed Jerry like this before. Jerry stomped on the gas pedal recklessly, showing no concern for the future servicing costs of his car. The engine screamed like a live pig being roasted, and the smoke took on the scent of burning plastic. Yet, Jerry ignored all the warning signs, reminding himself, ""Focus on the road, Jerry, or you'll end up like Dad,"" before taking another big bite of his food.   This became Jerry's inner resolve, a coping mechanism born from the anxiety that gripped him after receiving a late-night phone call delivering tragic news. It was a call that informed him, ""Your father is lying on Highway 97, with half of his guts spilling out onto the gearbox."" He went into self-preservation mode, retreating with enough food and shelter to hibernate. Now, Jerry's car and his dog provided him with shelter, and the missed calls only made him more eager to be reunited with his loyal companion.   Upon arriving at his house, Jerry hastily got out of the car without turning it off. His mind was racing. He fumbled through his keys, his hands trembling. He jerked open the doorknob and there he was, as always, wagging his tail, approaching Jerry with his adorable paws. The dog jumped on him, licking his beard, which Jerry absentmindedly scratched on the way home. They played together, and a single tear escaped Jerry's eye. But instead of finding solace and allowing himself to feel peace, his 24/7 anxious mind couldn't help but fixate on something else.   While entering the house he had noticed something peculiar, but he remained in ""Do Not Disturb"" mode until he met his dog. Then it hit him. The doorknob had been warm, indicating that someone had been in his house recently. His dog, usually alert and protective, hadn't barked at the intruder. Within seconds, Jerry realized that the intruder was someone he knew. It was Melena, his wife. Panic surged through his veins, and he frantically searched for his phone, but it was nowhere to be found.   From a distance, the volume on his car radio suddenly increased. The same news anchor's voice filled the car, announcing, ""Correction, it's not a prison break but an escape from a mental institution. Three inmates have fled, two males and one woman."" Jerry's feet turned to ice, and he tried to run outside, but his body was paralyzed with fear. The scent of his wife's hair tonic filled his senses, and he knew that she was staring at him from somewhere but he couldn't move anymore.",scarystories,0,2023-06-13 11:57:32
63,A case like no other,148ikzx,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148ikzx/a_case_like_no_other/,TheRealRufusGamer,"I, m28 have been a crime scene investigator for 7 years, but no case I ever saw was just as horrific as  this. I got called down to a crime scene, drove to the location I was given, and got out of my car. I walked to the crime scene, and saw something that made my stomach turn. An unidentifiable corpse, burnt to a crisp. And a man, hanging from a tree. Once we got the man down, we saw his jaw hanging from one side, and it looked like the killer gouged one of his eyeballs out and nailed it into his forehead. I walked about 15 feet into the scene, and I was on a tree, written in red spray paint. ""Kill the mother, hang the father, take the son."" I assumed the son had been kidnapped, so we got some of the man's DNA and found his name, and sure enough, he had a son. We tried to find him for at least 5 weeks. We got a distress call from a house in the woods. I had driven down that road countless times, but never saw the house. When we got into the house, and we were instantly met with the smell of a corpse. When we got to the basement, I almost passed out. At the time I had been doing this job for 6 years, but nothing came close to this. There were corpses that appeared to be young boys, skinned, missing their genitals, and hung by barbed wire on the wall. We heard a soft tune coming from a room to the left, when we entered the room, we saw a man with a saw, cutting flesh and bone. He seemed to be middle aged. We yelled at him, and when he turned around, he had no face. Just skin. I had never believed in paranormal things before, but this changed my mind.wr shot him over and over again. Until he was dead. We searched the house and found barrels of flesh and limbs, and even the genitals. But then we found the tapes of what he did to the kids. It was horrific. He skinned them and cut their genitals off while they were conscious. Sometimes he would even bite their fingers off with sharp teeth. It clearly wasn't human. A week later, I went to where the house was. It was gone. All that was left, was a dirt area. And painted in blood, it said ""Kill the mother, hang the father, take Anthony Dominguez"" that is my name. I am currently typing this from the basement of the demon that butchered those boys. He has told me I am next. Tell my wife and son I love them. I'm signing off. For good this time. Goodbye.    Everything in this story was fake. Anthony Dominguez doesn't exist. Have a nice day!",scarystories,0,2023-06-13 11:53:37
64,Blackwood,148ho1k,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/148ho1k/blackwood/,mtmr2022,"In the small town of Blackwood, nestled deep within the heartland of America, an unsettling legend prevailed among the locals. The tale spoke of an abandoned house situated on the outskirts of town‚Äîa house with a dark and twisted history.  The haunting began in the 1950s when the DeWitt family moved into the aging Victorian home. The DeWitts were an ordinary family, known for their kindness and community involvement. But as time went on, strange occurrences plagued their lives within those walls. Objects moved on their own, disembodied whispers echoed through the hallways, and an oppressive sense of dread hung in the air.  Whispers of a malevolent presence spread like wildfire throughout the town, and many believed that the house itself was cursed. Despite their mounting fear, the DeWitts refused to leave, determined to uncover the truth behind the haunting.  One fateful night, the eldest daughter, Emily, ventured into the attic‚Äîa place rumored to hold the key to the house's dark secret. As she climbed the creaky stairs, the air grew thick with an otherworldly presence. The attic door swung open with a chilling creak, revealing a space shrouded in darkness.  Emily's flashlight illuminated the room, revealing a collection of old photographs scattered across the dusty floor. As she sifted through them, a series of disturbing images caught her attention. Each photograph depicted a different family, seemingly frozen in fear, their eyes wide with terror.  As Emily's trembling hand reached the bottom of the stack, she found a picture of her own family, distorted and contorted in an agonizing state. A primal scream tore through her throat, echoing through the attic as she stumbled backward, the photographs scattering around her.  From that moment on, the house's malevolent presence intensified. Doors slammed shut, lights flickered ominously, and the whispers grew louder, taunting the family day and night. The DeWitts became prisoners in their own home, trapped within the clutches of a supernatural force.  In a final desperate act, the family sought the help of a renowned paranormal investigator, Professor Samuel Bennett. Armed with an arsenal of specialized equipment, Bennett arrived at the house, determined to unravel the truth behind the hauntings.  As night fell, the investigator and the DeWitts huddled together in the dimly lit living room. The temperature plummeted, and an icy breath brushed against their skin. Professor Bennett commanded the spirits to reveal themselves, daring them to show their true nature.  Suddenly, the house erupted into chaos. Furniture flew through the air, shattering against the walls. The walls groaned and shifted, as if alive. The malevolent presence materialized before them‚Äîa grotesque figure with hollow eyes and a twisted smile, emanating pure evil.  The investigator fought against the darkness, reciting incantations and performing rituals, while the DeWitts clung to each other in terror. The battle between the forces of light and darkness waged on, each side refusing to yield.  In a climactic moment, a blinding flash of light consumed the room. The evil presence let out an ear-piercing shriek before dissipating into the ether. The haunting had finally been vanquished.  Exhausted and relieved, the DeWitts emerged from the ordeal, their lives forever changed by the horrors they had witnessed. The town, once plagued by the curse of the house, now breathed a sigh of relief as the darkness that had loomed for decades was lifted.  To this day, the house stands as a chilling reminder of the evil that once resided within its walls. The legend of the DeWitt family's ordeal lives on, a tale whispered among locals as a chilling reminder of the thin veil that separates our world",scarystories,0,2023-06-13 11:12:07

There's a sweet scene in it, a lady says to a baby : You is kind. You is smart. You is strong.  And then my gf said to me: do you know what local pupils say before class?   They literally say this altogether in an uniform tone before some teachers giving their classes :    **Â∞èÁúºÁùõÔºåÁúãËÄÅÂ∏à„ÄÇ**  **Little eyes, looking at the teacher.**  **Â∞èÂò¥Â∑¥Ôºå‰∏çËØ¥ËØù„ÄÇ**  **Little mouths, let no voices out.**  **Â∞èËÄ≥ÊúµÔºåÁ´ñËµ∑Êù•„ÄÇ**  **Little ears, pick them up.**  usually it is not this crazy in school, my gf found this when taking over a class for an absent teacher   . So she was deeply scared and shocked at that moment.  Anyway, I don't think i translate this well. This thing has a strange rhythm in Chinese language, and the wording is pretty much like nursery-rhyme-style. So this is something really scary when you heard it for the first time.   Plus...  After she heard this doggerel, she said:  alright, let's turn to page xxx.   The next moment, again, they say this altogether in an uniform tone: OK, we turn to page xxx just right.  &#x200B;",scarystories,0,2023-06-13 11:03:46
